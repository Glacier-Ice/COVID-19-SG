         on 1 April 2020 until 14 April 2020 has also continued kinidi
         the third phase. After nearly a month of implementation both
         two PKP first and second phases, we can see the trend of
         COVID-19 new cases a controlled without increasing the
         dramatically. The number of daily cases were discharged from hospital
         increasing every day. It shows progress
         The favorable results of the implementation of the BCP, as
         trends can be seen in the number of active cases daily.

         Following the first phase and the second PKP, PKP third phase began
         effective today, ie 15 April 2020 to 28 April
         2020. The aim is to continue the existing KKM action
         there, as well as to intensify efforts to reduce the positive case
         COVID-19 in Malaysia using focused approach
         (Targeted approach).



     Compliance community on this directive is very important
     at this moment. However, based on monitoring
     conducted by the authorities as well as road traffic conditions
     observed in recent years, more and more people appear not
     CSC acknowledges the command.

     In this regard, the Ministry of Health welcomed the decision of the National Security Council in order to
     more decisive action is taken on a handful of non-conformity
     community. This is expected to have a positive impact in
     leveling curve (flatten the curve) and so ensure
     MOH facilities can accommodate the number of patients COVID-19. MOH
     concerned non-compliance with the BCP can cancel the order
     hard all those who have taken so far. Thank you
     to assist the authorities in enforcing
     BCP command so that the conformity could be improved.

     Therefore, the Ministry of Health called for the cooperation of all Malaysians in
     play their part in tackling the spread of
     epidemic and ensure the chain of infection can COVID-19
     disconnected.
     This effort can be achieved by continuing to practice the things
     following:
       1. Obeying the PKP.
       2. A high level of personal hygiene at all times as
        Frequently wash your hands with soap and water.
       3. Social distance secure (social distancing) at least 1
        meters from others.
     MOH also understand that there are some people who
     must be present on duty especially for essential services. Therefore,
     MOH would advise them:
       1. Avoid being in crowded areas (crowded space)
        and a closed area (confined space) for beramai-
        many such in the dining room at the office,
       2. Maintain a distance of 1 meter when talking face to face with people
        Other (conversation).


         3. Ensure that the dining room at the office of the net income, including
           use disinfection to ensure that frequent the area
           touch is free from germs.

       INFECTION COVID-19
       Ministry of Health would like to inform that some applications have been
       accepted for the purposes of verification Disinfection Box /
       Chamber / Tunnel / Booth / Partition / Gate to reduce
       COVID-19 infection, in which it was evaluated by Branch
       Health Technology Assessment, MOH. As this was
       reported to have been used as tools disinfect the poultry in
       some countries.

       The country and also from some models
       existing in Malaysia. It was found that the process disinfect the poultry
       by equipment rated involve someone with equipment
       for a period of 20-30 seconds in which individuals will be sprayed
       using chemicals to disinfect the poultry goal. all
       The model has been studied using different chemicals.
       The results of the assessment conducted found that no
       evidence to show that the equipment is effective
       in reducing infection COVID-19. The period 20-30
       while not sufficient to effectively disinfect the poultry process.
       The process also can not kill germs in the body
       human. Furthermore the chemicals used can
       bring harm to the body membrane (membrane
       mucosa) as the eyes and mouth.
       Based on this assessment, the MOH does not suggest
