         among non-citizens. They include


         groups of tourists, foreign workers, refugees and

         Of these, the leading countries are:
         • 108 cases consist of Indonesian citizens
         • 104 cases consisting of Filipino
         • 63 cases consists of a Bangladeshi

         COVID-19 increase in cases in Singapore is associated with
         transmission COVID-19 in dormitories. It is reported to have
         contribute to more than 50 percent of the cases
         positive COVID-19 in the country. Taking a cue from
         This situation, and given that Malaysia also has many
         foreign workers, measures should be taken to prevent
         COVID-19 infection, especially among foreigners.
         For industries that use a lot of labor, including
         of foreigners among employees, employers are
         responsible for ensuring that the following measures
         is implemented in the workplace:
         • Check the temperature before entering the body and symptoms
            premises;
         • Provision of hand washing or hand sanitizer;
         • Regularly carry out the process of cleaning and disinfecting
            especially germ similar to space;
         • Practice safe social distance of at least 1 meter
            including in the work space and dining areas such as: -
              o Avoid the workers gathered in a narrow space (confined
                 space)
              o Avoid too many workers together at one time
                 (Congregation)
              o Maintain a distance of 1 meter during the talk (close
                 conversation)


       If the shelter is available, prevention measures
       particularly the practice of safe social distance and hand hygiene
       and myself should be emphasized. Employees who have
       their own homes also have to comply with and adopt measures
       The preventive measures as well as taking the initiative
       themselves to regularly carry out sanitation and cleaning the house /
       each residence.
       MOH also together with the mobilization of United
       Nations High Commission for Refugees (UNHCR) to ensure
       refugees and asylum seekers (asylum seeker) also
       covered in prevention and control activities undertaken
       by the Government.
       MOH works closely with the embassies of the countries
       in Malaysia as well as non-governmental organizations (NGOs)
       related, in order to assist the Ministry of Health in an effort to spread
       and delivery of information to foreigners in Malaysia
       in their native language. National IHR Focal Points
       (NFPs) from the countries concerned will also be informed

       Malaysia.
