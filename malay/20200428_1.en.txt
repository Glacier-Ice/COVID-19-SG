          BRIEF ANALYSIS OF THE SITUATION AFTER EXECUTION
          MOVEMENT CONTROL ORDER TO PHASE-3
          Implementation Control Order Movement (BCM) Phase 3 will
          phase 4 from tomorrow ie 29 April 2020. So far,
          found the number of daily cases often show a downward trend and
          sometimes horizontal. With the increase of cases resolved
          of COVID-19, this makes the number of active cases
          decreased during the third phase of the BCP. This once successful
          leveling curve (flattening of the curve) and the State now
          entering a recovery phase.
          For example, the number of active cases today is 1,719, compared
          The highest active case, ie 2,596 on 5 April 2020. This achievement
          is the result of a proactive and aggressive government action in
          containment of the spread of activities throughout COVID-19
          period before and during this PKP. This ensures that the facility
          MOH can accommodate the number of patients COVID-19 in Malaysia,
          including the capacity of the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) and capacity
          ve use of mechanical ventilation (ntilators) in the hospital.
          Motion Control Order (EFS) help reduce
          interaction between community members and reducing the
          kebolehjangkitan COVID-19. In addition to activities for case detection
          active (active case detection), the Ministry of Health with various agencies
          approach focused (targeted approach) for


      high-risk groups. This includes the detection,
      screening, testing, isolation and treatment for individuals in
      Bolted Movement Control Commands area (PKPD)
      detection participants gathering in Seri Petaling and
      other mass gatherings, schools and detection
      tahfiz school and so on.

      NORMA NEW DAILY LIFE AS A RESULT OF TRANSMISSION
      COVID-19
      BCM implementation in our country consists of four (4) plan
      action (action plan) key, in which two (2) action is by
      Government and two (2) more action is involving the community
      common. Measures taken Government's control
      movement and border control.
      Border control is needed to reduce cases
      import COVID-19 as more than 180 countries that
      affected by this infection. Border control has been good
      fruitful when 154 positive cases, 19 were detected COVID
      among Malaysians returning from abroad
      3 April 2020 began in March 2020. They have been isolated and treated
      hospitalization. Results motion control can also be seen
      from the implementation of BCM 1, 2 and 3 where it
      reduce interaction between community members and
      reduce kebolehjangkitan COVID-19.
      However, it can not eliminate COVID PKP-19
      completely. In fact, people should be prepared to face
      This virus for longer periods. MOH will continue
      the activities of containment and control. Nevertheless,
      active involvement of the people is very important.
      Thus, two (2) actions that have been and should continue to be taken by
      the people and the population in the fight against viruses COVID-19
      is to continue the practice of safe social distance
      at least one meter, and also maintain the level of
      hygiene, especially frequent hand washing
      water and soap. Since there is still no vaccine for


        COVID-19 against infection, this practice can
        a "vaccine" for the community to help countries combat
        the spread COVID 19th.
        As the Ministry of Health has been emphasizing all this, our struggle
        against COVID-19, which is an invisible enemy is still
        we have a long and continuous effort. Norma lives
        The new needs to be applied to all levels of society in order to
        it's a practice we all.
        It turned out that the success and achievements of the curve and attenuate
        control the spread of the virus COVID-19 is a joint success,
        namely the People and Government.

        RELATED HEALTH ADVICE COVID-19
        In line with the fight against this pandemic, once again MOH
        advised Malaysians continue to discharge
        with their respective responsibilities:
          • Adhere to practice optimum hygiene in
