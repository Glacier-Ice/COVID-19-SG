 EFFECTIVENESS ANALYSIS CENTERED APPROACH
 (TARGETED APPROACH)
 Implementation Control Order Movement (BCM) has helped
 Government's efforts to flatten the curve (flattening of the curve),
 where achievements are the result of the cooperation of the various
 agencies and the public.
 PKP has enabled the implementation of activities focused approach
 (Targeted approach) to detect, filter, test,
 isolate and treat cases COVID 19th among
 community. The effectiveness of this method is evident when we see
 statistics of its execution, as follows:
 1. Bolted Movement Control Order (PKPD) in 11 localities
 high risk in which 607 positive cases detected COVID-19
 from 29.067 cases were screened (ie 2.1 per cent);
 2. Detection of the cluster assembly in Seri Petaling where 2,220
 COVID-19 positive cases detected than 34.503 cases have been
 sampled (ie 6.4 per cent);
 3. Detection of students and school staff and tahfiz
 related gathering in Seri Petaling whereby
 378 COVID-19 positive cases detected than 8,030 cases have been
 sampled (ie 4.7 per cent);
 4. Screening and placement in quarantine center for all
 Malaysians returning from abroad since 3 April 2020, in
 where the 274 positive cases, 19 were detected COVID of 26,169
 people who have been quarantined (ie 1:05 per cent).

 Trends positive cases COVID 19th day lately
 showed an increase in cases of imported cases detected
 of locality PKPD. However, people should not be concerned about


 increase in cases among cases import or PKPD this,
 because they are already beginning to be separated is filtered.

 Activities transmission COVID 19th among the local communities
 can be identified through clinical surveillance activity (clinical
 surveillance) COVID-19 infection that has long run. this
 Sampling was conducted with Influenza Like Illness (ILI)
 from sentinel sites across the country and patients Severe Acute
 Respiratory Infection (SARI) in all MOH hospitals.

 As of May 1, 2020, a total of 7,880 screenings COVID-19 in
 Clinical surveillance activities have been conducted in which only 12 cases
 detected from the Ili (0.81 per cent) and 54 cases were detected from
 SARI (0.84 per cent).

 In addition, screening COVID-19 also applies to all
 patient anxiety before surgery and partial emergency
 MoH hospitals as a precautionary measure in spreading COVID-19
 among health workers. As of May 1, 2020, there were only
 five (5) positive cases detected COVID 19 of 5,435 total
 patients who are screened (ie only 0.09%).

 Thus, it is evident that ongoing activities focused approach
 so far been effective in detecting and curbing
 COVID 19th outbreak in the country. However, it requires
 parallel actions of the people to obey all the instructions and advice
 Government health.


 HOSPITAL CAPACITY COVID-19 RESULTS THAT HAVE CURVES
 trim

 Following the curve has flattened, MOH hospitals now have
 more capacity to treat more patients COVID-19
 if it's necessary.

 For example, the overall rate of use of beds in 40
 designated hospital for treatment COVID 19 and 26 centers
 COVID-19 treatment of low-risk (hospital extension centers)
 is 17 percent.



 In addition, the use of bed Intensive Care Unit (ICU) of
 devoted to patients suspected and confirmed positive COVID-19
 is seven (7) percent (ie 31 out of a total of 422 pieces).
 Use a respirator (ventilator) is the only
 one (1) percent (ie 12 out of the total 1,059 pieces).


 RELATED HEALTH ADVICE COVID-19

 MOH would like to remind Malaysians that the pandemic
 COVID-19 is not over yet. Globally, as many as 187
 the country has been impressed by the number of positive cases, 19 were present COVID
 reached 3,343,777 with 238.650 deaths. The risk of transmission
 dramatically in our country still exist if we are negligent and
 negligent in adopting new norms of everyday life such as:

 • Adopt measures such as the practice of a health
 secure social (social distancing) of at least 1 meter from
 others;
 • Encouraged the use of a face mask (face
 mask), especially in the common areas;
