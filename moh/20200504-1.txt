transmission. As there have been no more cases linked to Little Gems
Preschool (3 Ang Mo Kio Street 62) and the dormitory at 55 Sungei Kadut
Loop for the past two incubation periods (i.e. 28 days), the clusters
have now been closed.

links for 798 previously unlinked cases.
6.           Further epidemiological investigations and contact tracing
