Expansion of Enhanced Stay-home Notice Requirements to More Countries



EXPANSION OF ENHANCED STAY-HOME NOTICE REQUIREMENTS TO MORE COUNTRIES


Published Date: 04 Apr 2020

  To protect Singaporeans and further ring fence the risk of
community transmission from imported cases, all Singapore Citizens,
Permanent Residents and Long Term Pass holders returning from ASEAN
countries, France, India and Switzerland from 5 April 2020, 2359 hours
will be required to serve a 14-day self-isolation at dedicated Stay-Home
Notice (SHN) facilities. This arrangement will continue to apply to
returnees from the UK and US.

2.  The dedicated SHN facilities are not just about the
provision of hotel rooms. We also work with the hotel operators to
provide training for their staff, and to put in place proper security
arrangements, as well as infection control and precautions. It takes
time to get ready such facilities, and we do not have enough at present
to accommodate all returnees. Therefore based on the current capacity,
we have prioritised the facilities for returnees from these specific
countries. The countries are chosen based on our assessment of risks and
the history of imported cases in Singapore. For those who are coming
back from other countries, they can serve their 14-day SHN at their
place of residence.

3.  The Multi-Ministry Taskforce will continue to monitor the
dynamic and evolving COVID-19 situation, and work closely with the
private sector to adjust our capacity of SHN facilities accordingly.
