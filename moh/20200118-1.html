    <p>Published Date: 18 Jan 2020</p> <p>As of 10am, 18 January 2020, the Ministry of Health (MOH) has been notified of a 52 year-old male Singapore resident with pneumonia, who had travel history to Wuhan. He has been admitted for further assessment and treatment, and isolated as a precautionary measure. His condition is stable.</p><p>The suspect case did not visit the Huanan seafood wholesale market associated with the cluster of pneumonia in Wuhan.</p><p><u>Update on two suspect cases reported on 17 January</u></p><p>Epidemiological investigations, clinical assessment and laboratory test results from the two suspect cases reported on 17 January 2020 involving a 64 year-old male Chinese national and a 61 year-old female Singapore resident, both with pneumonia and travel history to Wuhan, have found that the cases are not linked to the novel Coronavirus pneumonia cluster in Wuhan. The two cases have also tested negative for coronavirus.</p><p>MOH will continue to monitor the situation closely. As medical practitioners are on the lookout for cases&nbsp;with pneumonia who have recently returned from Wuhan,&nbsp;Singapore is likely to see more suspect cases that will need to be investigated for possible links to the Wuhan cluster.</p><p>We urge the public to remain vigilant and to adopt good personal hygiene practices at all times. Travellers to Wuhan should monitor their health closely and seek medical attention promptly if they feel unwell, and also inform their doctor of their travel history.</p></body>
