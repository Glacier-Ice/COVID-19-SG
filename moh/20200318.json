To date, there are close to 200,000 COVID-19 cases across 159 countries, and more than 7,900 deaths. Many countries have seen an exponential rise in cases recently, and more than 40,000 new cases have been reported in the past three days. Globally the number of cases and deaths has surpassed those in China since the beginning of the outbreak. The World Health Organization has urged its member states to take urgent and aggressive measures to stop the transmission of COVID-19.<br><br>3.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;In Singapore, over the past three days<sup>[1]</sup>, about 70 percent of our new COVID-19 cases were imported, most of whom were Singapore residents and long-term pass holders returning to Singapore after travel abroad.<br><br><strong>Singaporeans advised to defer all travel abroad<br></strong><br>4.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;In view of the heightened risk of further importation of COVID-19 to Singapore, Singaporeans are advised to defer all travel abroad with immediate effect. This supercedes our earlier advisory announced on 15 March to defer all non-essential travel abroad.<sup>[2]</sup>&nbsp;The expansion of the travel advisory is to reduce the risk of Singaporeans being infected with the virus when abroad, and spreading it to other Singaporeans when they return.<br><br><strong>14-Day Stay-Home Notice for all travellers<br></strong><br>5.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;To further reduce the risk of further importation leading to community spread in Singapore, the Multi-Ministry Taskforce will put in place additional measures for all travellers entering Singapore. From 20 March 2020, 2359 hours, all Singaporeans, Permanent Residents, Long Term Pass holders and short term visitors entering Singapore will be issued a 14-day Stay-Home Notice (SHN).<sup>[3]</sup>&nbsp;They will have to provide proof of the place where they will serve the 14-day SHN, for example a hotel booking covering the entire period, or a place of residence they or their family members own.<br><br>6.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;As announced previously, short-term visitors with recent travel history to mainland China, France, Germany, Iran, Italy, Republic of Korea and Spain, are not allowed to enter or transit in Singapore.<br><br>7.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;For the land crossings with Malaysia, there are already restrictions imposed by Malaysia under their Movement Control Order. The Singapore-Malaysia Special Working Committee (co-chaired by Senior Minister and Coordinating Minister for National Security Teo Chee Hean, and Malaysian Senior Minister and Minister of Defence Dato' Sri Ismail Sabri Yaakob and Johor Menteri Besar Datuk Ir. Hasni Mohammad) are discussing a joint mitigation plan to ensure the safe and sustainable movement of people, goods and services between the two countries.
