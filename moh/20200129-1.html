    <p>Published Date: 29 Jan 2020</p> <p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Arial,sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;">&nbsp;</span></p> <p style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 0in;"><span style="font-family: Arial,sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;">1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As of 29 January 2020, 2pm, the Ministry of Health (MOH) has confirmed three additional cases of Wuhan coronavirus infection in Singapore. Seven confirmed cases were earlier announced by MOH</span><span style="font-family: Arial,sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;">.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Arial,sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;">2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All three cases are Chinese nationals who travelled from Wuhan. This is consistent with our assessment that more imported cases are expected <span>from Hubei province.</span> There is currently no evidence of community spread in Singapore.</span><br></p><p></p><p><strong><span style="font-family: Arial,sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;">About the cases</span></strong><br></p><p><u><span style="font-family: Arial,sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;">Cases 8 and 9</span></u></p><p><font face="Arial,sans-serif" size="3">3. &nbsp; &nbsp; The eighth and ninth cases are a 56 year-old female and 56 year-old male respectively. The married couple are both Chinese nationals from Wuhan who arrived together in Singapore on 19 January. They are currently warded in isolation rooms at the National Centre for Infectious Diseases (NCID).</font></p><p></p><p></p><p><font face="Arial,sans-serif" size="3">4. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Both cases reported that they were asymptomatic during the flight to Singapore. They subsequently developed symptoms on 24 January, and took a taxi to Tan Tock Seng Hospital on 27 January. They were classified as suspect cases and immediately isolated at NCID. Subsequent test results confirmed Wuhan coronavirus infection on 28 January at about 11pm and 29 January at about 2pm respectively. </font></p><p></p><p></p><p><font face="Arial,sans-serif" size="3">5. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Prior to hospital admission, the cases stayed with their family at their home at Lorong Lew Lian.&nbsp;</font><br></p><p></p><p></p><p><u><span style="font-family: Arial,sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;">Case 10</span></u></p><p><font face="Arial,sans-serif" size="3">6. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The tenth confirmed case is a 56 year-old male Chinese national who arrived in Singapore from Wuhan on 20 January. He is currently warded in an isolation room at NCID. </font></p><p></p><p></p><p><font face="Arial,sans-serif" size="3">7. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The case reported that he was asymptomatic during his flight to Singapore. He subsequently developed symptoms on 21 January, and was admitted to NCID on 28 January after being identified as a suspect case at a health screening station at Marina South Pier. Subsequent test results confirmed Wuhan coronavirus infection on 29 January at about 2pm.</font></p><p></p><p></p><p><font face="Arial,sans-serif" size="3">8. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Prior to hospital admission, the case worked and lived on board a cargo vessel. </font></p><p></p><p></p><p><font face="Arial,sans-serif" size="3">9. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;MOH has initiated epidemiological investigations and contact tracing to identify individuals who had close contact with the cases.</font>&nbsp;<br></p><p></p><p></p><p><strong><span style="font-family: Arial,sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;">Update on condition of confirmed cases</span></strong><br></p><p></p><p><span style="font-family: Arial,sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;">10. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The three new cases are stable currently, and we are continuing to monitor their health. As for the seven previously announced cases, all of them remain in stable condition, and most are improving.&nbsp;</span></p><p><strong><span style="font-family: Arial,sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;">Update on suspect cases</span></strong><br></p><p><span><span style="font-family: Arial,sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;">11. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As of 29 January, 12pm, 124 of the suspect cases have tested negative for the Wuhan coronavirus, and eight have tested positive (cases 9 and 10 were confirmed at about 2pm). Test results for the remaining 70 cases are pending. </span></span></p><p><span><strong><span style="font-family: Arial,sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;">Update on contact tracing for confirmed cases</span></strong></span><br></p><p><span><span style="color: black; font-family: Arial,sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;">12. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Contact tracing for the confirmed cases is ongoing. Once identified, MOH will closely monitor all close contacts. As a precautionary measure, they will be quarantined for 14 days from their last exposure to the patient. In addition, all other identified contacts who have a low risk of being infected will be under active surveillance, and will be contacted daily to monitor their health status.</span></span></p><p><font face="Arial,sans-serif"><font size="3">13. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style="color: black;">As of 29 January, 12pm, MOH has identified 144 close contacts. Of the 115 who are still in Singapore, 111 have been contacted and are being quarantined or isolated. Efforts are ongoing to contact the remaining four close contacts</span><span style="color: rgb(112, 48, 160);">.</span></font></font></p><p></p><p><strong><span style="color: black; font-family: Arial,sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;">Health advisory<br></span></strong></p><p>14.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style="color: black; font-family: Arial,sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;">Singaporeans are advised to defer all travel to Hubei Province and all non-essential travel to Mainland China. </span></p><p></p><p></p><p><font face="Arial,sans-serif"><font size="3">15. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style="color: black;">All travellers should monitor their health closely for two weeks upon return to Singapore and seek medical attention promptly if they feel unwell. Travellers should inform their doctor of their travel history. If they have a fever or respiratory symptoms (e.g. cough, shortness of breath), they should wear a mask and call the clinic ahead of the visit.</span></font></font></p><p></p><p></p><p><font face="Arial,sans-serif"><font size="3">16. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style="color: black;">Travellers and members of the public should adopt the following precautions at all times:&nbsp;</span></font></font><br></p><p></p> <ul style="list-style-type: disc;"><li><span style="color: black; font-family: Arial,sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;">Avoid contact with live animals including poultry and birds, and consumption of raw and undercooked meats; </span></li><li><span style="color: black; font-family: Arial,sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;">Avoid close contact with people who are unwell or showing symptoms of illness; </span></li><li><span style="color: black; font-family: Arial,sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;">Observe good personal hygiene; </span></li><li><span style="color: black; font-family: Arial,sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;">Practise frequent hand washing with soap (e.g. before handling food or eating, after going to toilet, or when hands are dirtied by respiratory secretions after coughing or sneezing); </span></li><li><span style="color: black; font-family: Arial,sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;">Wear a mask if you have respiratory symptoms such as a cough or shortness of breath; </span></li><li><span style="color: black; font-family: Arial,sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;">Cover your mouth with a tissue paper when coughing or sneezing, and dispose the soiled tissue paper in the rubbish bin immediately; and </span></li><li><span style="color: black; font-family: Arial,sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;">Seek medical attention promptly if you are feeling unwell.</span></li></ul> <p style="text-align: justify;"><font face="Arial,sans-serif" size="3">17. &nbsp; &nbsp; </font><span style="font-family: Arial,sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;">MOH will continue to monitor the situation closely. As medical practitioners are on the lookout for cases with pneumonia who have recently been in China, Singapore is likely to see more suspect cases that will need to be investigated for possible links to the Wuhan cluster.</span></p></body>
