            As of 24 April 2020, 12pm, the Ministry of Health (MOH) has
confirmed and verified an additional 897 cases of COVID-19 infection in
Singapore. The breakdown is as follows:
A)   IMPORTED CASES: 0
There are no imported cases today.
B)   CASES IN THE COMMUNITY: 25 (13 Singaporeans/Permanent Residents, 12
Work Passes)
The number of new cases in the community has decreased, from an average
of 31 cases per day in the week before, to an average of 25 per day in
the past week. The number of unlinked cases in the community has also
decreased, from an average of 20 cases per day in the week before, to an
average of 17 per day in the past week. We will continue to closely
monitor these numbers, as well as the cases detected through our
surveillance programme.
C)   WORK PERMIT HOLDERS (RESIDING OUTSIDE DORMITORIES): 19
The number of new cases amongst Work Permit holders residing outside
dormitories has continued to increase, from an average of 19 cases per
day in the week before, to an average of 28 per day in the past week.
D)   WORK PERMIT HOLDERS (RESIDING IN DORMITORIES): 853
The main increase today continues to be for Work Permit holders residing
in dormitories, where we are picking up many more cases because of
extensive testing. Most of these cases have a mild illness and are being
monitored in the community isolation facilities or general ward of our
hospitals. None of them is in the intensive care unit.
2.          Details of these trends can be found in MOHâ€™s daily
situation Report (www.moh.gov.sg/covid-19/situation-report). Please

3.          Of the new cases, 68% are linked to known clusters, while
the rest are pending contact tracing.
4.          MOH has been monitoring existing clusters for any further
transmission. As there have been no more cases linked to PCF Sparkletots
Preschool @ Fengshan Blk 126 (126 Bedok North Street 2) for the past two
incubation periods (i.e. 28 days), the cluster has now been closed.
LINKS BETWEEN PREVIOUS CASES FOUND

links for 1,132 previously unlinked cases.
6.         Further epidemiological investigations and contact tracing
