If they have a fever or respiratory symptoms (e.g. cough, runny nose), they should wear a mask and call the clinic ahead of the visit.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Given the evolving situation and ongoing investigations in China, Singapore residents who need to travel to the affected areas are advised to regularly check MOH\u2019s website (<a href=\"http://www.moh.gov.sg/\">www.moh.gov.sg</a>) for updates. Travellers to China are also advised to stay vigilant, monitor developments and heed the advice of the local Chinese authorities while in China.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>5.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MOH has put in place precautionary measures to reduce the risk of importation of the virus to Singapore. The definition of suspect cases from 22 January 2020 include persons with:</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>(i) pneumonia and travel history to China within 14 days before onset of symptoms; or</p> <p>(ii) acute respiratory infection who had been to any hospital in China, within 14 days before onset of symptoms.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>These cases will be isolated in hospital as a precautionary measure to prevent transmission.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>6.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; From 22 January 2020, temperature screening at Changi Airport has also been expanded to all inbound travellers on flights arriving from China, and suspect cases meeting the expanded definition above will be referred to hospitals for further assessment. Health Advisory Notices are issued to all travellers arriving at Changi Airport from China, and health advisory posters are displayed at land and sea checkpoints.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>7.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MOH has also reminded doctors and healthcare workers to be vigilant, and maintain strict infection control and prevention measures.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>8.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To date, there have been no confirmed cases of the novel coronavirus reported in Singapore. However, given the high volume of international travel to Singapore, we expect to see more suspect cases, and&nbsp; imported cases. Once a case is confirmed, contact tracing will be initiated, and we will implement strict isolation, quarantine, and infection control and prevention measures to prevent further transmission.</p> <p><br></p>", "PressCategory": ["Press Releases"], "CustomDetailUrl": "", "UrlName": "moh-issues-public-health-travel-advisory-in-response-to-cases-of-novel-coronavirus-in-china", "CurrentPageUrl": null}, {"Title": "Update On Local Situation Regarding Severe Pneumonia Cluster In Wuhan", "PublishedDate": "/Date(1579629600000)/", "LastModifiedDateTimeList": null, "PublishedDateStr": "22 Jan 2020", "Summary": "", "MainContent": "<div>As of 4pm, 22 January 2020, the Ministry of Health (MOH) has been notified of three additional suspect cases with pneumonia, who had travel history to mainland China.
