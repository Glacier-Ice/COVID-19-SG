Update On Local Situation Regarding Severe Pneumonia Cluster In Wuhan



UPDATE ON LOCAL SITUATION REGARDING SEVERE PNEUMONIA CLUSTER IN WUHAN


Published Date: 05 Jan 2020

As of 3pm, 5 January 2020, the Ministry of Health (MOH) has not been
notified of any new suspect cases.

Epidemiological investigations, clinical assessment and laboratory test
results from the suspect case reported on 4 January 2020 involving a 3
year-old female Chinese national with pneumonia and travel history to
Wuhan have found that the case is not linked to the pneumonia cluster in
Wuhan. The case has also tested negative for SARS and MERS-CoV. The
cause of her pneumonia is Respiratory Syncytial Virus, a common cause
for childhood respiratory infection.

As medical practitioners are on the lookout for cases with pneumonia who
have recently returned from Wuhan, Singapore is likely to see more
suspect cases that will need to be investigated for possible links to
the Wuhan cluster. MOH will continue to monitor the situation closely.
We urge the public to remain vigilant and to adopt good personal hygiene
practices at all times. Travellers to Wuhan should monitor their health
closely and seek medical attention promptly if they feel unwell, and
also inform their doctor of their travel history.
