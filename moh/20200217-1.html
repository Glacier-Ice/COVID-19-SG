Travellers should inform their doctor of their travel history. If they have a fever or respiratory symptoms (e.g. cough, shortness of breath), they should wear a mask and call the clinic ahead of the visit.<br><br>15&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Travellers and members of the public should adopt the following precautions at all times:</p><ul><li>Avoid close contact with people who are unwell or showing symptoms of illness; </li><li>Observe good personal hygiene; </li><li>Practise frequent hand washing with soap (e.g. before handling food or eating, <p>after going to toilet, or when hands are dirtied by respiratory secretions after coughing or sneezing); </p></li><li>Wear a mask if you have respiratory symptoms such as a cough or shortness of breath; </li><li>Cover your mouth with a tissue paper when coughing or sneezing, and dispose the soiled tissue paper in the rubbish bin immediately; and </li><li>Seek medical attention promptly if you are feeling unwell.<br></li></ul><p>16&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; MOH will continue to monitor the situation closely.
