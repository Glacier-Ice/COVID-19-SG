Once identified, MOH will closely monitor all close contacts. As a precautionary measure, they will be quarantined for 14 days from their last exposure to the patient. In addition, all other identified contacts who have a low risk of being infected will be under active surveillance, and will be contacted daily to monitor their health status.</p><p>20.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As of 19 February 2020, 12pm, MOH has identified 2,593 close contacts who have been quarantined.

Travellers should inform their doctor of their travel history. If they have a fever or respiratory symptoms (e.g. cough, shortness of breath), they should wear a mask and call the clinic ahead of the visit.</p><p>23.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Travellers and members of the public should adopt the following precautions at all times:&nbsp;<br></p> <ul><li>  Avoid close contact with people who are unwell or showing symptoms of illness; </li><li>Observe good personal hygiene; </li><li>Practise frequent hand washing with soap (e.g. before handling food or eating, <p>after going to toilet, or when hands are dirtied by respiratory secretions after coughing or sneezing); </p></li><li>Wear a mask if you have respiratory symptoms such as a cough or shortness of breath; </li><li>Cover your mouth with a tissue paper when coughing or sneezing, and dispose the soiled tissue paper in the rubbish bin immediately; and </li><li>Seek medical attention promptly if you are feeling unwell.</li></ul>24.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MOH will continue to monitor the situation closely. As medical practitioners are on the lookout for suspect cases, Singapore is likely to see more cases that will need to be investigated.<p><br><strong>MINISTRY OF HEALTH</strong></p><div> </div> <strong>19 FEBRUARY 2020</strong> <div><br clear="all"> <hr width="33%" size="1" align="left"> <div id="ftn1"> <p><a name="_ftn1" title="" href="file:///C:/Users/Yap%20Wei%20Qiang/Desktop/Wei%20Qiang/MOH%20Briefing%20-%20Wuhan%20Pneumonia/Press%20Release-Confirmed%20cases%2082%20to%2084-Draft%2019Feb%20(final).docx#_ftnref1">[1]</a> Case 66 is a 28 year-old male Singapore Citizen with no recent travel history to China.
