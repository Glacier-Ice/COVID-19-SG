1. As of 23 April 2020, 12pm, the Ministry of Health (MOH) has confirmed
and verified an additional 1,037 cases of COVID-19 infection in
Singapore. The breakdown is as follows:

  There are no imported cases today.

Residents¹, 3 Work Passes)
The number of new cases in the community has decreased, from an average
of 34 cases per day in the week before, to an average of 25 per day in
the past week. The number of unlinked cases in the community has
decreased slightly, from an average of 20 cases per day in the week
before, to an average of 18 per day in the past week. We will continue
to closely monitor these numbers, as well as the cases detected through
our surveillance programme.

The number of new cases amongst Work Permit holders residing outside
dormitories has continued to increase, from an average of 16 cases per

  D) WORK PERMIT HOLDERS (RESIDING IN DORMITORIES): 982
The main increase today continues to be for Work Permit holders residing
in dormitories, where we are picking up many more cases because of
extensive testing. Most of these cases have a mild illness and are being
monitored in the community isolation facilities or general ward of our
hospitals. None of them is in the intensive care unit.

reflect where the confirmed cases are being cared for. There are

most are stable or improving, and 26 are in critical condition in the
intensive care unit. 8,874 are isolated and cared for at community

well but still test positive for COVID-19. 12 have passed away from
complications due to COVID-19 infection.
