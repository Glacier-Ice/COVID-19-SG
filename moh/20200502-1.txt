Additional Covid-19 Support Measures for All Homes Serving the Elderly



ADDITIONAL COVID-19 SUPPORT MEASURES FOR ALL HOMES SERVING THE ELDERLY


Published Date: 02 May 2020

1. The Ministry of Health (MOH) and Ministry of Social and Family
Development (MSF) will implement additional support measures for all
homes serving the elderly to further reduce the risk of COVID-19
exposure for staff and residents. These include nursing homes, welfare
homes, sheltered homes and adult disability homes (“Homes"). All Homes
will continue to implement safe distancing and infection control
measures in full compliance with previous advisories.
COVID-19 TESTS FOR STAFF AND RESIDENTS
2. Testing is a critical enabler of Singapore’s fight against COVID-19,
and allows us to heighten protection for vulnerable settings. The
Multi-Ministry Taskforce has been steadily building up our national
capacity to conduct tests for COVID-19, in tandem with a comprehensive
medical strategy to ensure that individuals infected with COVID-19
receive prompt and quality medical treatment.
3. Homes serve highly vulnerable and frail seniors, who are at higher
risk of developing serious health complications if infected with
COVID-19. The Taskforce recognises the need to support these Homes to
strengthen the safety of their environment. MOH and MSF will therefore
prioritise testing for residents and staff in all homes serving the
elderly. This will ensure that any COVID-19 infections in the Homes are
detected as early as possible for treatment, as well as to limit
transmission. This new support measure complements existing measures on
safe distancing and movement restrictions within the Homes, which had
been put in place earlier.
4. MOH commenced COVID-19 testing from 29 April 2020 and target to
complete the tests by next week, while MSF commenced the tests from 30
April 2020 and will complete them by 2 May. Prior to this, we had been
actively testing symptomatic residents and staff who developed Acute
Respiratory Infection or fever for COVID-19.
5. The Ministries are providing full funding support for the costs of
all tests, and all follow-up treatment that is required.
ACCOMMODATION SUPPORT FOR ALL RESIDENT-FACING STAFF
6. To ensure a safe environment in the Homes, broad-based testing will
be complemented by further measures to reduce the exposure of staff and
residents to COVID-19 infection risks in the community. This includes
ensuring resident-facing staff who enter and leave the Homes daily have
a protected living environment to minimise the chances of them
contracting the virus and bringing it into the Homes.
7. We are working with the Homes to facilitate lodging for staff who
interact with residents of Homes at designated accommodation facilities
on-site or at hotels, to reduce their exposure to the community during
the circuit breaker period¹. We will arrange for staff of the Homes to
stay at hotels if the Home they work at is unable to house them on-site.
8. For staff who have to move into hotels, we will provide funding for
the accommodation and for the Homes to provide meals, dedicated
transport and daily necessities for the staff. MOH will also provide
support for nursing homes to enhance onsite accommodation spaces to
improve safe distancing, where necessary.
9. A $500 allowance will be provided to affected staff to assist them
with the transition for the current measures. We understand that the
move could cause inconvenience to the affected staff and appreciate
their sacrifices and efforts in keeping our elderly safe.
10. We acknowledge and appreciate the dedication of all staff and the
management of the Homes, who have stepped up amidst the challenges and
are working hard to care for their residents. The Government remains
committed to support and work closely with the Homes to strengthen
safety and protection for everyone. Through our collective efforts, we
will be better able to protect those who are more vulnerable in our
community.
