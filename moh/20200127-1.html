    <p>Published Date: 27 Jan 2020</p> <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;As of 27 January 2020, 2pm, the Ministry of Health (MOH) has confirmed another imported case of Wuhan coronavirus infection in Singapore. Four confirmed cases were earlier announced by MOH.</p> <p>2.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The fifth confirmed case is a 56 year-old female Chinese national from Wuhan who arrived in Singapore with her family on 18 January. She is currently warded in an isolation room at the National Centre for Infectious Diseases (NCID) and her condition is stable.</p><p>3.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The case reported that she was asymptomatic during the flight to Singapore. She subsequently developed symptoms on 24 January, and was conveyed by ambulance to Tan Tock Seng Hospital on 26 January. She was classified as a suspect case and immediately isolated at NCID. Subsequent test results confirmed Wuhan coronavirus infection on 27 January. She has no known links to the other confirmed imported cases. <p><br>4.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Prior to hospital admission, the case stayed with her family at their home at Ceylon Road. Since onset of symptoms on 24 January, the case had remained in her home until she was conveyed to hospital on 26 January.</p></p><p><p>5.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;MOH has initiated epidemiological investigations and contact tracing to identify individuals who had close contact with her.</p></p><p><p><strong>Update on suspect cases</strong></p></p><p>6.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;As of 27 January, 12pm, 62 of the suspect cases have tested negative for the Wuhan coronavirus, and four have tested positive (the fifth case was confirmed at about 2pm). Test results for the remaining 57 cases are pending. <p><br><strong>Update on contact tracing for confirmed cases</strong></p></p><p>7.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Contact tracing for the confirmed cases is ongoing. Once identified, MOH will closely monitor all close contacts. As a precautionary measure, they will be quarantined for 14 days from their last exposure to the patient. In addition, all other identified contacts who have a low risk of being infected will be under active surveillance, and will be contacted daily to monitor their health status.<p><br>8.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;As of 27 January, 12pm, MOH has identified 115 close contacts from the first four confirmed cases. Of the 86 who are still in Singapore, 75 have been contacted and are being quarantined or isolated. Efforts are ongoing to contact the remaining 11 close contacts.</p></p><p><p><strong>Health advisory</strong></p></p><p>9.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Singaporeans are advised to defer all travel to Hubei Province and all non-essential travel to Mainland China. <p><br>10.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; All travellers should monitor their health closely for two weeks upon return to Singapore and seek medical attention promptly if they feel unwell. Travellers should inform their doctor of their travel history. If they have a fever or respiratory symptoms (e.g. cough, shortness of breath), they should wear a mask and call the clinic ahead of the visit.</p></p><p><p>11.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Travellers and members of the public should adopt the following precautions at all times:</p></p> <ul><li>Avoid contact with live animals including poultry and birds, and consumption of raw and undercooked meats; </li><li>Avoid close contact with people who are unwell or showing symptoms of illness; </li><li>Observe good personal hygiene; </li><li>Practise frequent hand washing with soap (e.g. before handling food or eating, after going to toilet, or when hands are dirtied by respiratory secretions after coughing or sneezing); </li><li>Wear a mask if you have respiratory symptoms such as a cough or shortness of breath; </li><li>Cover your mouth with a tissue paper when coughing or sneezing, and dispose the soiled tissue paper in the rubbish bin immediately; and </li><li>Seek medical attention promptly if you are feeling unwell.</li></ul><p>12.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;MOH will continue to monitor the situation closely. As medical practitioners are on the lookout for cases with pneumonia who have recently been in China, Singapore is likely to see more suspect cases that will need to be investigated for possible links to the Wuhan cluster.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p></body>
