LINKS BETWEEN PREVIOUS CASES FOUND

3.  Further epidemiological investigations and contact
tracing have uncovered links between previously announced and new cases.
This was made possible with the assistance of the Singapore Police
Force.

a)  Four of the locally transmitted confirmed cases (Cases 31, 33,
38 and 83), as well as Cases 8 and 9, are linked to The Life Church and
Missions Singapore (146B Paya Lebar Road).

UPDATE ON CONTACT TRACING FOR CONFIRMED CASES

10.  Contact tracing for the confirmed cases is ongoing. Once
identified, MOH will closely monitor all close contacts. As a
precautionary measure, they will be quarantined for 14 days from their
last exposure to the patient. In addition, all other identified contacts
who have a low risk of being infected will be under active surveillance,
and will be contacted daily to monitor their health status.

11.  As of 23 February 2020, 12pm, MOH has identified 2,812
close contacts who have been quarantined. Of these, 908 are currently
quarantined, and 1,904 have completed their quarantine.

HEALTH ADVISORY
12.  Singaporeans are advised to defer all travel to Hubei
Province and all non-essential travel to Mainland China.

13.  All travellers should monitor their health closely for two
weeks upon return to Singapore and seek medical attention promptly if
they feel unwell. Travellers should inform their doctor of their travel
history. If they have a fever or respiratory symptoms (e.g. cough,
shortness of breath), they should wear a mask and call the clinic ahead
of the visit.

14.  Travellers and members of the public should adopt the
following precautions at all times:

-   Avoid close contact with people who are unwell or showing symptoms
    of illness;
-    Observe good personal hygiene;
-   Practise frequent hand washing with soap (e.g. before handling food
    or eating, after going to toilet, or when hands are dirtied by
    respiratory secretions after coughing or sneezing);
-   Wear a mask if you have respiratory symptoms such as a cough or
    shortness of breath;
-   Cover your mouth with a tissue paper when coughing or sneezing, and
    dispose the soiled tissue paper in the rubbish bin immediately; and
-   Seek medical attention promptly if you are feeling unwell.

15.  MOH will continue to monitor the situation closely. As
medical practitioners are on the lookout for suspect cases, Singapore is
likely to see more cases that will need to be investigated.
