The suspension will take effect from 22 February 2020 on an interim basis, pending the criminal proceedings in relation to his alleged cheating of the Central Provident Fund Board into disbursing monies from patients’ MediSave accounts by submitting MediSave claims for surgical procedures which he had not performed. These claims were made between 2013 and 2014 when he was practising at WH Dental Surgeons[1].</p><p style="text-align: justify;">2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dr Sng was charged in Court in July 2018 for offences of cheating and forgery for the purpose of cheating under the Penal Code, Chapter 224, and has claimed trial.

However, he will not be able to make MediSave claims on behalf of his patients for dental treatment and surgical procedures.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">5.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MOH takes a serious view of breaches of our MediSave guidelines and will not hesitate to take action where non-compliance is uncovered. We also remind healthcare professionals to uphold a high standard of professionalism and to adhere to the Ethical Code and Ethical Guidelines.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">6.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MOH encourages patients to actively engage their doctors and dentists if they have any queries on their bills.
