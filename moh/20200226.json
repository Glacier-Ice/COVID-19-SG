Hu arrived in Singapore on 22 January 2020 and was confirmed to be infected with COVID-19 on 31 January.

Hu has since fully recovered from the infection and had been discharged from hospital on 19 February.<br></p><p>3. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; Once a COVID-19 case is confirmed, MOH initiates contact tracing to identify individuals who may have been exposed to the case while he/she was symptomatic. Close contacts are monitored closely and may be quarantined, so that they can be identified and treated early if they develop the disease. This measure also prevents close contacts from mingling in the community if they become symptomatic, and helps to contain further transmission of COVID-19.&nbsp;<br></p><p>4. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; Both Hu and Shi had given false information to MOH officials about their movements and whereabouts from 22 January to 29 January when they were contacted for the purposes of contact tracing.
