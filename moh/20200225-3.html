As she had been identified as a contact of Case 66, she was referred by MOH to the National Centre for Infectious Diseases (NCID) on 18 February. Subsequent test results confirmed COVID-19 infection on 22 February afternoon.</p><p>8.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Prior to hospital admission, she had mostly stayed at her home at Rivervale Drive.</p><p><strong>Update on condition of confirmed cases</strong></p><p>9.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To date, a total of 58 cases have fully recovered from the infection and have been discharged from hospital.

Seven are in critical condition in the intensive care unit.</p><p><strong>Update on contact tracing for confirmed cases</strong></p><p>10.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Contact tracing for the confirmed cases is ongoing. Once identified, MOH will closely monitor all close contacts. As a precautionary measure, they will be quarantined for 14 days from their last exposure to the patient. In addition, all other identified contacts who have a low risk of being infected will be under active surveillance, and will be contacted daily to monitor their health status.</p><p>11.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As of 25 February 2020, 12pm, MOH has identified 2,846 close contacts who have been quarantined. Of these, 371 are currently quarantined, and 2,475 have completed their quarantine.</p><p><strong>Health advisory<br></strong><br>12.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Singaporeans are advised to defer all travel to Hubei Province and all non-essential travel to Mainland China, and Daegu city and Cheongdo county in the Republic of Korea. MOH also reminds the public to continue to exercise caution when travelling to the rest of the Republic of Korea.</p><p>13.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; All travellers should monitor their health closely for two weeks upon return to Singapore and seek medical attention promptly if they feel unwell. Travellers should inform their doctor of their travel history. If they have a fever or respiratory symptoms (e.g. cough, shortness of breath), they should wear a mask and call the clinic ahead of the visit.</p><p>14.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Travellers and members of the public should adopt the following precautions at all times:</p><p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Avoid close contact with people who are unwell or showing symptoms of illness;</p><p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Observe good personal hygiene;</p><p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Practise frequent hand washing with soap (e.g. before handling food or eating, after going to toilet, or when hands are dirtied by respiratory secretions after coughing or sneezing);</p><p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Wear a mask if you have respiratory symptoms such as a cough or shortness of breath;</p><p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Cover your mouth with a tissue paper when coughing or sneezing, and dispose the soiled tissue paper in the rubbish bin immediately; and</p><p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Seek medical attention promptly if you are feeling unwell.</p><p>15.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MOH will continue to monitor the situation closely. As medical practitioners are on the lookout for suspect cases, Singapore is likely to see more cases that will need to be investigated.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><div><hr align="left" size="1" width="33%"><div id="ftn1"><p>[1] Case 66 is a 28 year-old male Singapore Citizen with no recent travel history to China who was confirmed to have COVID-19 infection on 14 February.</p><p>&nbsp;</p></div></div></body>
