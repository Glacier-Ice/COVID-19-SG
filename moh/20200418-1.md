    <body><h1>38 More Cases Discharged, 942 New Cases of Covid-19 Infection Confirmed</h1>
    <p>Published Date: 18 Apr 2020</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As of 18 April 2020, 12pm, the Ministry of Health (MOH) has confirmed and verified an additional 942 cases of COVID-19 infection in Singapore. The breakdown is as follows: </p><p><strong>a)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Imported cases: 0 </strong></p><p>There are no imported cases today.&nbsp;&nbsp; </p><p><strong>b)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Cases in the community: 22 (14 Singaporeans/Permanent Residents, 6 Work Passes, 1 Dependant’s Pass, 1 Long-Term Visit Pass)</strong></p><p>The number of new cases in the community has decreased, from an average of 40 cases per day in the week before, to an average of 31 per day in the past week. The number of unlinked cases in the community has increased slightly, from an average of 19 cases per day in the week before, to an average of 22 per day in the past week.&nbsp; </p><p>We will continue to monitor the numbers carefully as the circuit breaker period continues. The contact tracing and epidemiology teams are working to identify the source of infection for the unlinked cases, but this will become increasingly difficult as time passes. Our surveillance programme is also ongoing, where a small sample of patients at our primary care facilities are tested for COVID-19 infection. The cases picked up through this surveillance is an indication of the presence of undetected cases in the community.</p><p><strong>c)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Work Permit holders (residing outside dormitories): 27</strong></p><p>The number of new cases amongst Work Permit holders residing outside dormitories has increased, from an average of 11 cases per day in the week before, to an average of 21 per day in the past week.&nbsp; </p><p><strong>d)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Work Permit holders (residing in dormitories): 893</strong></p><p>The main increase today continues to be for Work Permit holders residing in dormitories, in line with our continued efforts to actively test and isolate the infected workers. Most of these cases are young, have a mild illness and are being monitored in the community isolation facilities or general ward of our hospitals. None of them is in the intensive care unit. </p><p>2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Details of these trends can be found in MOH’s daily situation Report (<a title="" href="http://www.moh.gov.sg/covid-19/situation-report" target="_blank" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=http://www.moh.gov.sg/covid-19/situation-report&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1587306923796000&amp;usg=AFQjCNEF7-crYThPiIRhiwjdx0vEYwH83w">www.moh.gov.sg/covid-19/<wbr>situation-report</a>). </p><p>3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Of the new cases, 79% are linked to known clusters, while the rest are pending contact tracing. </p><p>4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MOH has been monitoring existing clusters for any further transmission. As there have been no more cases linked to boulder+ Gym (12 Kallang Avenue) for the past two incubation periods (i.e. 28 days), the cluster has now been closed. </p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Links between previous cases found</strong></p><p>5.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the past week (11 April to 17 April), MOH has uncovered links for 517 previously unlinked cases (see <a title="Annex A" href="/docs/librariesprovider5/pressroom/press-releases/annex-a9aa73f32ea744f49936bfc43b3612c43.pdf?sfvrsn=304054e0_2">Annex A</a>). </p><p>6.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Further epidemiological investigations and contact tracing have uncovered links between previously announced and new cases.
