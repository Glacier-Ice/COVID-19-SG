CONCEPT AND PRICE REVENUE TENDER
3. A Concept and Price Revenue Tender approach was adopted to evaluate
this tender. This is to ensure that the selected concept proposal aligns
with the vision of the dementia care village.
4. Under this approach, tenderers are required to submit their concept
proposals and tender prices separately. The concept proposals will first
be evaluated by a Concept Evaluation Committee, chaired by MOH, against
a set of criteria which include the suitability of the proposed model of
care for persons with dementia, as well as the quality of the care
programmes and services. Only concept proposals that are shortlisted
will proceed to the second stage for evaluation based on price only.
5. This is not an announcement of tender award. A decision on the award
of the tender will be made after the tender has been evaluated. This
will be published at a later date.
