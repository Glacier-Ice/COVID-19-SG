This will allow patients whose conditions are stable to avoid a physical visit to a clinic during this period of heightened alert due to COVID-19.&nbsp;<br><br>&nbsp;<br><strong>In Support of Safe Distancing during COVID-19 Outbreak</strong><br><br>2.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Currently, CHAS subsidy and MediSave are only available for physical consultations. To support safe distancing, CHAS Chronic subsidy and MediSave will be extended to video consultations of seven selected chronic conditions under the Chronic Disease Management Programme (CDMP). Patients can tap on the prevailing CHAS Chronic subsidy and MediSave (i.e. MediSave500 and Flexi-MediSave) limits to offset the cost of video consultation, related drugs and investigations.<br><br>3.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; These chronic conditions are diabetes, hypertension, lipid disorder, major depression, schizophrenia, bipolar disorder and anxiety<sup>[1]</sup>. Patients with these conditions can generally be managed through video consultations without physical examination if these conditions are stable. Together, they also account for a high proportion of patients who use CHAS and MediSave for their chronic treatments.<br><br>4.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The extension will remain active until the de-activation of the Public Health Preparedness Clinic (PHPC) scheme, or as otherwise determined by MOH.<br><br><br><strong>Ensuring Patient Safety</strong><br><br>5.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Healthcare professionals who wish to provide video consultations which can be paid using CHAS subsidies and MediSave will be required to undergo telemedicine e-training to familiarise themselves with the best practices. Details will be made available to healthcare professionals separately.<br><br>6.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Healthcare providers should only carry out video consultations for patients that providers had physical consultations with previously, so that they can confirm the patient\u2019s suitability for video consultation before its use. Whenever it is assessed to be necessary, such as when a physical examination is required, the provider should ask the patient to come into the clinic for a physical consultation.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>7.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The list of healthcare institutions providing CHAS Chronic subsidy and MediSave for video consultations of the selected chronic conditions can be found at <a title=\"\" href=\"http://www.moh.gov.sg/covid-19/vc\" target=\"\">www.moh.gov.sg/covid-19/vc</a>&nbsp;from 3 Apr 2020. The number of providers will be progressively ramped up as more providers adopt video consultation. Patients may also wish to check with their healthcare provider to ascertain their suitability for video consultations of the selected chronic conditions.<br><br>&nbsp;<br><strong>MINISTRY OF HEALTH<br>31 MARCH 2020</strong><br><br><sup>[1] </sup>CHAS Chronic subsidy and MediSave can only be claimed for major depression, schizophrenia, bipolar disorder and anxiety at CDMP+ accredited clinics.

This new service is in line with MOH\u2019s ongoing efforts to improve the quality, accessibility and affordability of palliative care.<br><br><strong>Continued Enhancements to Palliative Care in the Community<br></strong><strong></strong><br>2 &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; In view of the varied models of care across inpatient palliative care services, the Inpatient Palliative Care Review Workgroup, co-chaired by Dr Angel Lee (Medical Director of St Andrew\u2019s Community Hospital and then-Chairman of the Singapore Hospice Council), and then-Deputy Director of Medical Services Associate Professor Kenneth Mak, was set up to review the inpatient palliative care landscape.<br><br>3 &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; The Workgroup recommended consolidating the existing inpatient services offered in community hospitals and inpatient hospices into a single service type, with a standardised service framework centred around patients\u2019 needs instead of defining it by setting. MOH accepted the recommendation and has been working closely with inpatient palliative care providers to launch IHPCS.</span></span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: Arial; font-size: 13px;\"><strong>Launch of IHPCS<br></strong></span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: Arial; font-size: 13px;\">4 &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; With the IHPCS, a common service framework will be introduced to ensure that all service providers are able to provide a standard scope of services to meet the needs of palliative patients, tiered into general and specialised palliative care.<a name=\"_ftnref1\" title=\"\" href=\"file:///C:/Users/shireen/Desktop/200331%20IHPCS%20Press%20Release%20(final).docx#_ftn1\">[1]</a><br></span></p><ul><li><span style=\"font-family: Arial; font-size: 13px;\">General palliative care is for patients with palliative care needs that require inpatient management.

This promotes continuity of care and minimises the need for transfers to different care facilities. As all providers will be required to provide a standard scope of services, patients also have the option of a wider range of providers and can be more assured that their care needs will be fulfilled regardless of setting.<br><br>7 &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; All existing inpatient hospices and community hospitals offering inpatient palliative services will transit to offer IHPCS with effect from 1 April 2020.<a name=\"_ftnref2\" title=\"\" href=\"file:///C:/Users/shireen/Desktop/200331%20IHPCS%20Press%20Release%20(final).docx#_ftn2\">[2]</a> Patients can be admitted to IHPCS from acute hospitals. In addition, under IHPCS, we will also allow direct referrals from the community, such as from General Practitioners and Home Palliative Care providers. The expansion of referral pathways will improve the accessibility of inpatient palliative care for patients who require it and facilitate the right-siting of patients.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: Arial; font-size: 13px;\"><strong>Extension of subsidies to patients on IHPCS </strong></span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: Arial; font-size: 13px;\">8 &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; Singapore residents admitted into IHPCS are eligible for means-tested Government subsidies of up to 75%. To better support patients who require inpatient palliative care, MediShield Life coverage will be extended to all IHPCS patients, and MediSave withdrawal limits will be increased for patients with more complex needs (see <u>Table 1</u>).<br><br>9 &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; The extension of MediShield Life coverage to IHPCS was recommended by the MediShield Life Council as part of their on-going review of MediShield Life benefits and premiums, which is expected to be completed by end 2020.<br><br>10 &nbsp; &nbsp; With the launch of IHPCS on 1 April, this enhancement is implemented ahead of the completion of the MediShield Life review so that patients can benefit earlier.

In particular, patients using IHPCS will be able to access inpatient palliative care in a single setting even if their care needs change. With the various affordability enhancements, including the extension of MediShield Life coverage to IHPCS, we seek to provide greater reassurance to end-of-life patients and their caregivers.\u201d<br><br>12 &nbsp; &nbsp; The launch of IHPCS complements MOH\u2019s enhancements to palliative care to better address the needs of the community. As most Singaporeans wish to be cared for at home at the end of life, we have expanded the capacity of home palliative care and day hospice services and increased financial support for these services. Since 2019, we have also introduced a home-based respite care service for home palliative care patients and their caregivers.<br><br>13 &nbsp; &nbsp; For more information on IHPCS and other Intermediate and Long-Term Care Services, patients and their caregivers can visit the Agency for Integrated Care\u2019s website or approach their regular doctors or medical social workers.</span></p> <div><span style=\"font-family: Arial; font-size: 13px;\"><br clear=\"all\"> </span><hr width=\"33%\" size=\"1\" align=\"left\"> <div id=\"ftn1\"> <p><span style=\"font-family: Arial; font-size: 13px;\"><a name=\"_ftn1\" title=\"\" href=\"file:///C:/Users/shireen/Desktop/200331%20IHPCS%20Press%20Release%20(final).docx#_ftnref1\">[1]</a> With the exception of St Joseph\u2019s Home, which will only provide general palliative care. </span></p> </div> <div id=\"ftn2\"> <p><span style=\"font-family: Arial;\"><span style=\"font-size: 13px;\"><a name=\"_ftn2\" title=\"\" href=\"file:///C:/Users/shireen/Desktop/200331%20IHPCS%20Press%20Release%20(final).docx#_ftnref2\">[2]</a> Existing inpatient hospice providers are: Assisi Hospice, Bright Vision Hospital, Dover Park Hospice and St Joseph\u2019s Home.
