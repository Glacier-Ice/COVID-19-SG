As for the 13 previously announced cases, none is critically ill. All of them remain in stable condition, and most are improving.&nbsp;</p></p><p><p><strong>Update on suspect cases</strong></p><p>13.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; As of 31 January, 12pm, 198 of the suspect cases have tested negative for the Wuhan coronavirus, and 16 have tested positive (cases 15 and 16 were confirmed at about 2pm, 31 January). Test results for the remaining 35 cases are pending.</p></p><p><p><strong>Update on contact tracing for confirmed cases</strong></p><p>14.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Contact tracing for the confirmed cases is ongoing. Once identified, MOH will closely monitor all close contacts. As a precautionary measure, they will be quarantined for 14 days from their last exposure to the patient. In addition, all other identified contacts who have a low risk of being infected will be under active surveillance, and will be contacted daily to monitor their health status.</p></p><p><p>15.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;As of 31 January, 12pm, MOH has identified 202 close contacts. Of the 162 who are still in Singapore, 156 have been contacted and are being quarantined or isolated. Efforts are ongoing to contact the remaining six close contacts.</p></p><p><p><strong>Health advisory</strong></p><p>16.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Singaporeans are advised to defer all travel to Hubei Province and all non-essential travel to Mainland China.<br></p></p><p><p>17.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;All travellers should monitor their health closely for two weeks upon return to Singapore and seek medical attention promptly if they feel unwell. Travellers should inform their doctor of their travel history. If they have a fever or respiratory symptoms (e.g. cough, shortness of breath), they should wear a mask and call the clinic ahead of the visit.</p></p><p><p>18.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Travellers and members of the public should adopt the following precautions at all times:</p></p><ul><li>Avoid contact with live animals including poultry and birds, and consumption of raw and undercooked meats; </li><li>Avoid close contact with people who are unwell or showing symptoms of illness; </li><li>Observe good personal hygiene; </li><li>Practise frequent hand washing with soap (e.g. before handling food or eating, after going to toilet, or when hands are dirtied by respiratory secretions after coughing or sneezing); </li><li>Wear a mask if you have respiratory symptoms such as a cough or shortness of breath; </li><li>Cover your mouth with a tissue paper when coughing or sneezing, and dispose the soiled tissue paper in the rubbish bin immediately; and </li><li>Seek medical attention promptly if you are feeling unwell.</li></ul><p>19.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;MOH will continue to monitor the situation closely. As medical practitioners are on the lookout for cases with pneumonia who have recently been in China, Singapore is likely to see more suspect cases that will need to be investigated for possible links to the Wuhan cluster.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><div><br clear="all"> <hr align="left" size="1" width="33%"> <div id="ftn1"> </div></div><p><a href="#_ftnref1" name="_ftn1" title="">[1]</a> The second case is 53 year-old female Chinese national from Wuhan who arrived in Singapore on 21 January 2020.</p></body>
