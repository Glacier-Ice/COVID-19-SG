Additional Precautionary Measures to Prevent Further Importation of
COVID-19 Cases



ADDITIONAL PRECAUTIONARY MEASURES TO PREVENT FURTHER IMPORTATION OF COVID-19 CASES


Published Date: 15 Mar 2020

          Singapore will implement additional precautionary measures to
further reduce the risk of importation of COVID-19 to Singapore. These
include travel advisories against all non-essential travel abroad, and
further restrictions on travellers coming into Singapore.
2.        Globally, there are now more than 150,000 COVID-19 cases and
more than 5,000 deaths across 135 countries, and the numbers are
increasing rapidly. There have been more than 25,000 new cases since as
recently as 12 March (when the Multi-Ministry Taskforce last issued
precautionary measures) and a majority of these cases were reported
outside of China. The World Health Organization (WHO) has indicated that
the epicentre of the outbreak has now shifted to Europe, and there are
now more cases reported outside of China daily than that reported in
China at the height of its epidemic. The number of new cases imported
into mainland China from overseas has also surpassed its number of
locally transmitted new infections.
3.        In the past three days[1] alone, Singapore has seen an
increase of 25 new cases. Of these, more than three-quarters were
imported cases, of which close to 90 percent were Singapore Residents
(Singapore Citizens and Permanent Residents) and Singapore Long Term
Pass holders who had returned to Singapore from overseas. During the
same period, more than one quarter of imported cases were from ASEAN
countries. We have seen a number of these cases entering Singapore for
the purpose of seeking medical care, which imposes a significant burden
on Singapore’s healthcare resources during this critical period when we
are focused on containing the situation within Singapore.
BORDER RESTRICTIONS
4.        Based on this latest situation, the Multi-Ministry Taskforce
will put in place additional border restriction measures. From 16 March
2020, 2359 hours, all travellers (including Singapore Residents, Long
Term Pass holders, and short-term visitors) entering Singapore with
recent travel history to ASEAN countries[2], Japan, Switzerland, or the
United Kingdom within the last 14 days will be issued with a 14-day
Stay-Home Notice (SHN).[3] In addition, they will have to provide proof
of the place where they will serve the 14-day SHN, for example a hotel
booking covering the entire period, or a place of residence they or
their family members own. They may also be swabbed for testing for
COVID-19, even if asymptomatic. This is because of the risk of community
transmission in these countries and evidence of cases that have been
imported from these countries into Singapore.
5.        In addition to the SHN requirement, from 16 March 2020, 2359
hours, all short-term visitors who are nationals of any ASEAN country
will have to submit requisite information on their health to the
Singapore Overseas Mission in the country they are resident before their
intended date of travel. The submission will have to be approved by
Singapore’s Ministry of Health (MOH) before travel to Singapore, and the
approval will be verified by the Immigration and Checkpoints Authority
(ICA) officers at the Singapore checkpoints. Short-term visitors who
arrive in Singapore without the necessary approval will be denied entry
into Singapore.They are therefore advised to secure the approval before
making definitive travel bookings.
6.        The Ministry of Manpower (MOM) will also introduce new
measures for Foreign Domestic Workers entering Singapore. More details
will be announced by MOM.
7.        As previously announced, residents and long-term pass holders
returning from mainland China (outside Hubei province[4]), Iran, Italy,
France, Germany, Republic of Korea, and Spain will continue to be issued
a 14-day SHN upon return to Singapore, while short-term visitors from
these areas will not be allowed to enter or transit through Singapore.
8.        All travellers entering Singapore and exhibiting fever and/or
other symptoms of respiratory illness are required to undergo a COVID-19
swab test at the checkpoints, regardless of travel history. Such
travellers will also be issued a 14-day SHN, which they will have to
serve in full even if the result of the swab test is negative. Those who
meet the clinical suspect case definition will be conveyed to the
hospital for follow-up.
9.        Persons under SHN will have to remain in their place of
residence at all times for 14 days after entering Singapore.
10.       Singapore’s border control measures in relation to COVID-19,
including the new ones announced in this press statement, are summarised
in the Annex. These border restrictions will be reviewed in 30 days. The
Taskforce may extend the border restriction measures to more countries
as the global and local situation evolves.
TRAVEL ADVISORY
11.       With immediate effect, Singaporeans are advised to defer all
non-essential travel abroad. This advisory will apply for 30 days, and
will be reviewed thereafter. This is to reduce the risk of Singaporeans
contracting COVID-19 infection while overseas during this global
pandemic.
12.       Singaporeans who have made plans to travel abroad during the
March school holidays are advised to review their plans_._ All
travellers will be subject to the prevailing travel measures imposed by
their destination countries, and those imposed by Singapore upon their
return home. As the situation remains uncertain and will continue to
evolve, Singaporeans are advised to review their travel plans for the
coming months after the March school holidays as well.
13.       As Singapore’s measures will evolve according to the global
situation, Singaporeans should check the MOH website
(https://www.moh.gov.sg/covid-19) for the latest measures.
