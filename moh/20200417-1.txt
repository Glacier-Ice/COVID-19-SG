25 More Cases Discharged, 623 New Cases of Covid-19 Infection Confirmed



25 MORE CASES DISCHARGED, 623 NEW CASES OF COVID-19 INFECTION CONFIRMED


Published Date: 17 Apr 2020

         As of 17 April 2020, 12pm, the Ministry of Health (MOH) has
confirmed and verified an additional 623 cases of COVID-19 infection in
Singapore. The breakdown is as follows:

A) IMPORTED CASES: 1
We have one new imported case today who is serving Stay-Home Notice.
B) CASES IN THE COMMUNITY: 27 (22 Singaporeans/Permanent Residents, 4
work passes, 1 visitor)
It has been 11 days since the circuit breaker was implemented. The
number of new cases in the community has decreased, from an average of
40 cases per day in the week before, to an average of 32 per day in the
past week [1].
The circuit breaker measures appear to have helped, but we still have to
monitor carefully the numbers over the next few days. We are
particularly concerned that it is increasingly difficult to link the new
cases and identify the source of infection. In fact, the number of
unlinked cases in the community has increased slightly, from an average
of 19 cases per day in the week before, to an average of 22 per day in
the past week. We have an ongoing surveillance programme, where a small
sample of patients at our primary care facilities are tested for
COVID-19 infections. We have picked up some cases through these tests,
which is an indication of undetected cases in the community.
C) WORK PERMIT HOLDERS (RESIDING OUTSIDE DORMITORIES): 37
The number of new cases amongst Work Permit holders residing outside
dormitories has increased, from an average of 11 cases per day in the
week before, to an average of 19 per day in the past week.
D) WORK PERMIT HOLDERS (RESIDING IN DORMITORIES): 558

The main increase today continues to be for Work Permit holders residing
in dormitories, in line with our continued efforts to actively test and
isolate the infected workers. Most of these cases have a mild illness
and are being monitored in the community isolation facilities or general
ward of our hospitals. The cases are generally mild, and none of them is
in the intensive care unit.

2.   Details of these trends can be found in MOH’s daily situation
Report (www.moh.gov.sg/covid-19/situation-report).

3.  Of the new cases, 69% are linked to known clusters, while the rest
are pending contact tracing.

LINKS BETWEEN PREVIOUS CASES FOUND

4.   In the past week (10 April to 16 April), MOH has uncovered links
for 483 previously unlinked cases (see Annex A).

5.   Further epidemiological investigations and contact tracing have
uncovered links between previously announced and new cases. A summary of
the confirmed cases are in Annex B.
