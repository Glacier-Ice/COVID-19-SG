    <body><h1>MOH Steps Up Precautionary Measures In Response to Increase In Cases of Novel Coronavirus Pneumonia In Wuhan</h1>
    <p>Published Date: 20 Jan 2020</p> <ol><li>In response to the increase in cases of novel coronavirus pneumonia in Wuhan and exported cases to other cities and countries, as well as the anticipated increase in travel volume in the lead up to the Chinese New Year holidays, the Ministry of Health (MOH) will expand temperature screening at Changi Airport and issue Health Advisory Notices for all inbound travellers on flights arriving from China from 22 January 2020. <p>&nbsp;</p></li><li>Individuals with pneumonia and travel history to Wuhan within 14 days before onset of symptoms will be isolated in hospital as a precautionary measure to prevent transmission, and investigated. <p>&nbsp;</p></li><li>This is in addition to the other precautionary measures that MOH has put in place since the start of January 2020. From the evening of 3 January, temperature screening has been implemented at Changi airport for inbound travellers arriving on flights from Wuhan, and suspect cases have been referred to hospitals for further assessment. Health Advisory Posters have also been installed at Changi Airport to advise all travellers on the precautionary measures to take when travelling to or arriving from Wuhan.&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;</p></li><li>In addition, MOH and the National Centre for Infectious Diseases (NCID) have developed a joint clinical guidance on the novel coronavirus which advises on the management of suspect cases. The guidance has been disseminated to Emergency Department and Infectious Diseases physicians, and public sector hospital laboratories. MOH has also issued a reminder on 20 January to hospitals and General Practitioners to be vigilant for cases with pneumonia who have recently travelled to Wuhan.<p>&nbsp;</p></li><li>To date, there have been no confirmed cases of the novel coronavirus reported in Singapore. However, given that Singapore is a travel hub, we expect to see more suspect cases, and cannot rule out the possibility of imported cases. Once a case is confirmed, contact tracing will be initiated, and we will implement strict isolation, quarantine, and infection control and prevention measures to prevent further transmission.<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p><p><strong>Health Advisory</strong></p><p>&nbsp;</p></li><li>MOH urges the public to remain vigilant and to adopt good personal hygiene practices. All travellers to Wuhan should monitor their health closely and seek medical attention promptly if they feel unwell, and also inform their doctor of their travel history. <p>&nbsp;</p></li><li>Travellers and members of the public should adopt the following precautions at all times:&nbsp;<br></li></ol> <ul><li>Avoid contact with live animals including poultry and birds, and consumption of raw and undercooked meats;</li><li>Avoid close contact with people who are unwell or showing symptoms of illness;</li><li>Observe good personal hygiene;&nbsp;</li><li>Practise frequent hand washing with soap (e.g. before handling food or eating, after going to toilet, or when hands are dirtied by respiratory secretions after coughing or sneezing);&nbsp;</li><li>Wear a mask if you have respiratory symptoms such as a cough or runny nose;</li><li>Cover your mouth with a tissue paper when coughing or sneezing, and dispose the soiled tissue paper in the rubbish bin immediately; and</li><li>Seek medical attention promptly if you are feeling unwell.</li></ul> &nbsp;</body>
