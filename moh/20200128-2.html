    <p>Published Date: 28 Jan 2020</p> <p style="text-align: left;">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; As of 28 January 2020, 12pm, the Ministry of Health (MOH) has confirmed an additional two imported cases of Wuhan coronavirus infection in Singapore. Five confirmed cases were earlier announced by MOH.<br><br><strong>About the cases<br><br></strong><u>Sixth case<br><br></u>2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The six confirmed case is a&nbsp;<a name="m_-8198993966986806108_m_-8381106143550367804_OLE_LINK2">56 year-old male Chinese national from Wuhan&nbsp;</a>who arrived in Singapore with his family on 19 January. He is currently warded in an isolation room at Changi General Hospital (CGH) and his condition is stable.<br><br>3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The case reported that he was asymptomatic during the flight to Singapore. He subsequently developed symptoms on 25 January, and self-presented to CGH in a private car on 26 January. He was classified as a suspect case and immediately isolated. Subsequent test results confirmed Wuhan coronavirus infection on 27 January at about 11pm.<br><br>4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Prior to hospital admission, the case stayed with his family at their home at Pasir Ris Grove.<br><br><u>Seventh case<br><br></u>5.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The seventh confirmed case is a 35 year-old&nbsp;male&nbsp;Chinese national from Wuhan who arrived in Singapore on 23 January with family and friends. He is currently warded in an isolation room at the National Centre for Infectious Diseases (NCID) and his condition is stable.<br><br>6.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The case reported that he was asymptomatic during the flight to Singapore. He subsequently developed symptoms on 24 January, and self-presented to Raffles Hospital via public transport on the same day. He was classified as a suspect case and immediately conveyed to NCID via an ambulance. Subsequent test results confirmed Wuhan coronavirus infection on 27 January at about 11pm.<br><br>7.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Prior to hospital admission, the case stayed at Marina Bay Sands Singapore located at 10 Bayfront Avenue, and had travelled on public transport.&nbsp;The risk of infection from transient contact, such as on public transport or in public places, is assessed to be low.<br><br>8.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;MOH has initiated epidemiological investigations and contact tracing to identify individuals who had close contact with the cases. Both cases have&nbsp;no known links to the other confirmed imported cases.<br><br><strong>Health advisory<br><br></strong>9.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singaporeans are advised to defer all travel to Hubei Province and all non-essential travel to Mainland China.<br><br>10.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All travellers should monitor their health closely for two weeks upon return to Singapore and seek medical attention promptly if they feel unwell. Travellers should inform their doctor of their travel history. If they have a fever or respiratory symptoms (e.g. cough, shortness of breath), they should wear a mask and call the clinic ahead of the visit.<br><br>11.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Travellers and members of the public should adopt the following precautions at all times:<br>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Avoid contact with live animals including poultry and birds, and consumption of raw and undercooked meats;<br>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Avoid close contact with people who are unwell or showing symptoms of illness;<br>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Observe good personal hygiene;<br>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Practise frequent hand washing with soap (e.g. before handling food or eating, after going to toilet, or when hands are dirtied by respiratory secretions after coughing or sneezing);<br>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wear a mask if you have respiratory symptoms such as a cough or shortness of breath;<br>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cover your mouth with a tissue paper when coughing or sneezing, and dispose the soiled tissue paper in the rubbish bin immediately; and<br>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seek medical attention promptly if you are feeling unwell.<br><br>12.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;MOH will continue to monitor the situation closely. As medical practitioners are on the lookout for cases with pneumonia who have recently been in China, Singapore is likely to see more suspect cases that will need to be investigated for possible links to the Wuhan cluster.</p></body>
