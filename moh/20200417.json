The breakdown is as follows:</p><p><strong>a) Imported cases: 1</strong><br><br>We have one new imported case today who is serving Stay-Home Notice.&nbsp; &nbsp;<br><br><strong>b)</strong>&nbsp;<strong>Cases in the community: 27 </strong>(22 Singaporeans/Permanent Residents, 4 work passes, 1 visitor)<br><br>It has been 11 days since the circuit breaker was implemented. The number of new cases in the community has decreased, from an average of 40 cases per day in the week before, to an average of 32 per day in the past week [1].<br><br>The circuit breaker measures appear to have helped, but we still have to monitor carefully the numbers over the next few days. We are particularly concerned that it is increasingly difficult to link the new cases and identify the source of infection. In fact, the number of unlinked cases in the community has increased slightly, from an average of 19 cases per day in the week before, to an average of 22 per day in the past week.&nbsp;We have an ongoing surveillance programme, where a small sample of patients at our primary care facilities are tested for COVID-19 infections. We have picked up some cases through these tests, which is an indication of undetected cases in the community.<br><br><strong>c)</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>Work Permit holders (residing outside dormitories): 37<br><br></strong>The number of new cases amongst Work Permit holders residing outside dormitories has increased, from an average of 11 cases per day in the week before, to an average of 19 per day in the past week.&nbsp;<br><br><strong>d)&nbsp;Work Permit holders (residing in dormitories): 558</strong></p><p>The main increase today continues to be for Work Permit holders residing in dormitories, in line with our continued efforts to actively test and isolate the infected workers. Most of these cases have a mild illness and are being monitored in the community isolation facilities or general ward of our hospitals. The cases are generally mild, and none of them is in the intensive care unit.</p><h3> </h3><p>2.&nbsp; &nbsp;Details of these trends can be found in MOH\u2019s daily situation Report (<a href=\"http://www.moh.gov.sg/covid-19/situation-report\">www.moh.gov.sg/covid-19/situation-report</a>).</p><p><p>3.&nbsp; Of the new cases, 69% are linked to known clusters, while the rest are pending contact tracing.</p></p><p><p><strong>Links between previous cases found</strong></p><p>4.&nbsp; &nbsp;In the past week (10 April to 16 April), MOH has uncovered links for 483 previously unlinked cases (see <u><a href=\"/docs/librariesprovider5/2019-ncov/annex-a0b923cbd4d30406abaec93b530525cd8.pdf?sfvrsn=e2b0106c_0\" title=\"Annex A\">Annex A</a></u>).</p></p><p><p>5.&nbsp; &nbsp;Further epidemiological investigations and contact tracing have uncovered links between previously announced and new cases.

MOH will not hesitate to take enforcement action against those who fail to comply with the QO requirements. </p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>MINISTRY OF HEALTH<br>17 APRIL 2020</strong></p>", "PressCategory": ["Highlights", "Press Releases"], "CustomDetailUrl": "", "UrlName": "two-work-permit-holders-charged-for-breaching-quarantine-order", "CurrentPageUrl": null}]}, "pressItemDictionaryCount": 1, "allowPagination": true, "selectedCategoryForPagination": "Press Releases", "sectionsListingOrder": ["Press Releases"], "paginationInfoDictionary": {"Press Releases": {"ItemsPerPage": 10, "CurrentPageIndex": 0, "LastPageIndex": 0}}}
