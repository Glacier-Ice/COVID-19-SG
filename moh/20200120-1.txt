UPDATE ON LOCAL SITUATION REGARDING SEVERE PNEUMONIA CLUSTER IN WUHAN


Published Date: 20 Jan 2020

As of 10am, 20 January 2020, the Ministry of Health (MOH) has been
notified of a 44 year-old female Singapore resident with pneumonia, who
had travel history to Wuhan. She has been admitted for further
assessment and treatment, and isolated as a precautionary measure. Her
condition is stable.

The suspect case did not visit the Huanan seafood wholesale market
associated with the cluster of pneumonia in Wuhan.

Update on suspect case reported on 18 January

Epidemiological investigations, clinical assessment and laboratory test
results from the suspect case reported on 18 January 2020 involving a 52
year-old male Singapore resident with pneumonia and travel history to
Wuhan has found that the case is not linked to the novel Coronavirus
pneumonia cluster in Wuhan. The case has tested negative for
coronavirus.

MOH will continue to monitor the situation closely. As medical
practitioners are on the lookout for cases with pneumonia who have
recently returned from Wuhan, Singapore is likely to see more suspect
cases that will need to be investigated for possible links to the Wuhan
cluster.

We urge the public to remain vigilant and to adopt good personal hygiene
practices at all times. Travellers to Wuhan should monitor their health
closely and seek medical attention promptly if they feel unwell, and
also inform their doctor of their travel history.
