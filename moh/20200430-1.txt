               Minister for Health Mr Gan Kim Yong participated in the
Special Video Conference of Health Ministers of ASEAN and the United
States, held on 30 April 2020.
2.           The Special Video Conference was convened by the Republic
of Indonesia, in its capacity as the chair of the ASEAN Health Ministers
Meeting, to enhance cooperation between ASEAN and the US on the response
towards the COVID-19 pandemic. The attendees comprised Health Ministers
from ASEAN Member States, US Secretary of Health and Human Services, and
the ASEAN Secretary General.
3.           Mr Gan shared on three areas where ASEAN and the US can
expand cooperation to manage the pandemic, one of which is the conduct
of joint research for the development of therapeutics and vaccines for
COVID-19. This is the only way to shorten the crisis and until then,
countries should continue to flatten the curve and keep infections low
for as long as possible in order to ensure healthcare systems are not
overwhelmed. Mr Gan also emphasised the importance of ensuring supply
chain connectivity and minimising the impact on the welfare of peoples
and societies.
4.            Noting that the COVID-19 crisis will test our
institutions, healthcare systems, standards of governance, social
capital and resilience, Mr Gan highlighted the need for unity amongst
the international community in the fight against COVID-19.
