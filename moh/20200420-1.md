    <p>Published Date: 20 Apr 2020</p> <p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;As of 20 April 2020, 12pm, the Ministry of Health (MOH) has confirmed and verified an additional 1,426 cases of COVID-19 infection in Singapore. The breakdown is as follows:&nbsp;<br><br><strong>a) Imported cases: 0&nbsp;<br></strong><br>There are no imported cases today.&nbsp; &nbsp;<br><br><strong>b) Cases in the community: 25 </strong>(18 Singaporeans/Permanent Residents [1] and 7 Work Passes)<br><br>The number of new cases in the community has decreased, from an average of 39 cases per day in the week before, to an average of 29 per day in the past week. The number of unlinked cases in the community has remained relatively constant, with an average of 20 cases per day for the past two weeks. We will continue to closely monitor these numbers, as well as the cases detected through our surveillance programme.<br><br><strong>c) Work Permit holders (residing outside dormitories): 32<br></strong><br>The number of new cases amongst Work Permit holders residing outside dormitories has continued to increase, from an average of 13 cases per day in the week before, to an average of 24 per day in the past week.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br><strong>d) Work Permit holders (residing in dormitories): 1,369<br></strong><br>The main increase today continues to be for Work Permit holders residing in dormitories, where we are picking up many more cases because of extensive testing. These are not new infections as the workers are staying in their rooms and many have not reported sick. But when the teams go in to test them, many turn out to be positive. Most of these cases have a mild illness and are being monitored in the community isolation facilities or general ward of our hospitals. None of them is in the intensive care unit.&nbsp;<br><br>2.&nbsp; Details of these trends can be found in MOHâ€™s daily situation Report (<a href="http://www.moh.gov.sg/covid-19/situation-report" title="" class="" target="">www.moh.gov.sg/covid-19/situation-report</a>).
