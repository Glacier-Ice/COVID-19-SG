Four confirmed cases were announced on 23, 24 and 26 January.<br><br>2. MOH has been notified of a cumulative total of 92 suspect cases, of which 46 have tested negative for the Wuhan coronavirus, and four have tested positive.

The fourth confirmed case involves a 36 year-old male Chinese national from Wuhan who is currently being treated in an isolation ward at Sengkang General Hospital.&nbsp;<br><br>4. Prior to hospital admission on 24 January, the patient stayed at Village Hotel Sentosa and indicated that he had visited Universal Studios Singapore and Vivocity. He had travelled on public transport, including taxi. The risk of infection from transient contact, such as on public transport or public spaces, is assessed to be low.&nbsp;<br><br>5. Nine individuals have been identified as close contacts of the case. As of 26 January, 12pm, eight have been contacted, and are being quarantined. Efforts are ongoing to contact the remaining close contact.<br><br>Update on contact tracing for confirmed cases<br><br>6. Contact tracing for the confirmed cases is ongoing. Once identified, MOH will closely monitor all close contacts. As a precautionary measure, they will be quarantined for 14 days from their last exposure to the patient. In addition, all other identified contacts who have a low risk of being infected will be under active surveillance, and will be contacted daily to monitor their health status.<br><br>7. As of 26 January, 12pm, MOH has identified 115 close contacts from the four confirmed cases. Of the 86 who are still in Singapore, 66 have been contacted and are being quarantined or isolated. Efforts are ongoing to contact the remaining 20 close contacts.<br><br>Health advisory<br><br>8. Singaporeans are advised not to travel to the whole of Hubei Province. MOH also advises Singaporeans to continue to exercise caution and attention to personal hygiene when travelling to the rest of China.<br><br>9. All travellers should monitor their health closely for two weeks upon return to Singapore and seek medical attention promptly if they feel unwell. Travellers should inform their doctor of their travel history. If they have a fever or respiratory symptoms (e.g. cough, shortness of breath), they should wear a mask and call the clinic ahead of the visit.<br><br>10. Travellers and members of the public should adopt the following precautions at all times:&nbsp;<br><br>• Avoid contact with live animals including poultry and birds, and consumption of raw and undercooked meats;&nbsp;<br>• Avoid crowded places and close contact with people who are unwell or showing symptoms of illness;&nbsp;<br>• Observe good personal hygiene;&nbsp;<br>• Practise frequent hand washing with soap (e.g. before handling food or eating, after going to toilet, or when hands are dirtied by respiratory secretions after coughing or sneezing);&nbsp;<br>• Wear a mask if you have respiratory symptoms such as a cough or shortness of breath;&nbsp;<br>• Cover your mouth with a tissue paper when coughing or sneezing, and dispose the soiled tissue paper in the rubbish bin immediately; and&nbsp;<br>• Seek medical attention promptly if you are feeling unwell.<br><br>11. MOH will continue to monitor the situation closely. As medical practitioners are on the lookout for cases with pneumonia who have recently been in China, Singapore is likely to see more suspect cases that will need to be investigated for possible links to the Wuhan cluster.</body>
