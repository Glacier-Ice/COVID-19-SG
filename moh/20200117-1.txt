Update On Local Situation Regarding Severe Pneumonia Cluster In Wuhan



UPDATE ON LOCAL SITUATION REGARDING SEVERE PNEUMONIA CLUSTER IN WUHAN


Published Date: 17 Jan 2020

As of 2pm, 17 January 2020, the Ministry of Health (MOH) has been
notified of two additional suspect cases with pneumonia, who had travel
history to Wuhan. The cases involve a 64 year-old male Chinese national
and a 61 year-old female Singapore resident. Both cases have been
admitted for further assessment and treatment, and isolated as a
precautionary measure. They are in stable condition, and investigations
are ongoing.

The two cases did not visit the Huanan seafood wholesale market
associated with the cluster of pneumonia in Wuhan.

Update on suspect case reported on 16 January

Epidemiological investigations, clinical assessment and laboratory test
results from the suspect case reported on 16 January 2020 involving a 69
year-old male Singaporean with pneumonia and travel history to Wuhan
have found that the case is not linked to the pneumonia cluster in
Wuhan. The case has also tested negative for coronavirus.

MOH will continue to monitor the situation closely. As medical
practitioners are on the lookout for cases with pneumonia who have
recently returned from Wuhan, Singapore is likely to see more suspect
cases that will need to be investigated for possible links to the Wuhan
cluster.

We urge the public to remain vigilant and to adopt good personal hygiene
practices at all times. Travellers to Wuhan should monitor their health
closely and seek medical attention promptly if they feel unwell, and
also inform their doctor of their travel history.
