Published Date: 11 Feb 2020

                 Singapore and Malaysia will establish a joint working
group to further enhance cooperation to prevent and control the spread
of 2019-novel Coronavirus (2019-nCoV).
2.              The objective of the joint working group is to
strengthen collaborations and enhance communication between both
countries, in order to better understand and limit the spread of
2019-nCoV. Senior health officials from both countries will work closely
together over the next few days to determine the composition and Terms
of Reference of this joint-workgroup. Singapore has nominated Senior
Minister of State for Transport and Health, Dr Lam Pin Min, to co-chair
the joint working group.
3.              At a video conference today, Singapore Minister for
Health, Mr Gan Kim Yong and Malaysia Minister for Health, YB Datuk Seri.
Dr. Dzulkefly Ahmad updated the situations in the respective countries
and discussed public health measures, epidemiological findings and
clinical management of the disease.
4.              The Ministers agreed that it is important for health
officials from both countries to continue working closely together
against the on-going outbreak, especially since the high travel volume
between the two countries. Bilateral health cooperation and timely
sharing of information  will play a critical role in managing the
2019-nCoV.
5.              Since the start of the outbreak, both countries have
been in close touch with one another, including expeditiously sharing
information on cross-border cases. The cooperation would not have been
possible without the strong collaboration and network built up over the
years.
