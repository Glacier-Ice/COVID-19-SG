33 MORE CASES DISCHARGED, 1,426 NEW CASES OF COVID-19 INFECTION CONFIRMED


Published Date: 20 Apr 2020

       As of 20 April 2020, 12pm, the Ministry of Health (MOH) has
confirmed and verified an additional 1,426 cases of COVID-19 infection
in Singapore. The breakdown is as follows:
A) IMPORTED CASES: 0
There are no imported cases today.
B) CASES IN THE COMMUNITY: 25 (18 Singaporeans/Permanent Residents [1]
and 7 Work Passes)
The number of new cases in the community has decreased, from an average
of 39 cases per day in the week before, to an average of 29 per day in
the past week. The number of unlinked cases in the community has
remained relatively constant, with an average of 20 cases per day for
the past two weeks. We will continue to closely monitor these numbers,
as well as the cases detected through our surveillance programme.
C) WORK PERMIT HOLDERS (RESIDING OUTSIDE DORMITORIES): 32
The number of new cases amongst Work Permit holders residing outside
dormitories has continued to increase, from an average of 13 cases per
day in the week before, to an average of 24 per day in the past week.
D) WORK PERMIT HOLDERS (RESIDING IN DORMITORIES): 1,369
The main increase today continues to be for Work Permit holders residing
in dormitories, where we are picking up many more cases because of
extensive testing. These are not new infections as the workers are
staying in their rooms and many have not reported sick. But when the
teams go in to test them, many turn out to be positive. Most of these
cases have a mild illness and are being monitored in the community
isolation facilities or general ward of our hospitals. None of them is
in the intensive care unit.

3.     Of the new cases, 63% are linked to known clusters, while the
rest are pending contact tracing.
LINKS BETWEEN PREVIOUS CASES FOUND
4.       In the past week (13 April to 19 April), MOH has uncovered
links for 484 previously unlinked cases.
5.    Further epidemiological investigations and contact tracing have
uncovered links between previously announced and new cases. Please refer
to Annex B for details.
UPDATE ON CONDITION OF CONFIRMED CASES
6.    33 more cases [2] of COVID-19 infection have been discharged from
hospitals or community isolation facilities. In all, 801 have fully
recovered from the infection and have been discharged from hospitals or
