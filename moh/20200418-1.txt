38 MORE CASES DISCHARGED, 942 NEW CASES OF COVID-19 INFECTION CONFIRMED


Published Date: 18 Apr 2020

  As of 18 April 2020, 12pm, the Ministry of Health (MOH) has
confirmed and verified an additional 942 cases of COVID-19 infection in
Singapore. The breakdown is as follows:

A)  IMPORTED CASES: 0

There are no imported cases today.

B)  CASES IN THE COMMUNITY: 22 (14 SINGAPOREANS/PERMANENT
RESIDENTS, 6 WORK PASSES, 1 DEPENDANT’S PASS, 1 LONG-TERM VISIT PASS)

The number of new cases in the community has decreased, from an average
of 40 cases per day in the week before, to an average of 31 per day in
the past week. The number of unlinked cases in the community has
increased slightly, from an average of 19 cases per day in the week
before, to an average of 22 per day in the past week.

We will continue to monitor the numbers carefully as the circuit breaker
period continues. The contact tracing and epidemiology teams are working
to identify the source of infection for the unlinked cases, but this
will become increasingly difficult as time passes. Our surveillance
programme is also ongoing, where a small sample of patients at our
primary care facilities are tested for COVID-19 infection. The cases
picked up through this surveillance is an indication of the presence of
undetected cases in the community.

C)  WORK PERMIT HOLDERS (RESIDING OUTSIDE DORMITORIES): 27

The number of new cases amongst Work Permit holders residing outside
dormitories has increased, from an average of 11 cases per day in the
week before, to an average of 21 per day in the past week.

D)  WORK PERMIT HOLDERS (RESIDING IN DORMITORIES): 893

The main increase today continues to be for Work Permit holders residing
in dormitories, in line with our continued efforts to actively test and
isolate the infected workers. Most of these cases are young, have a mild
illness and are being monitored in the community isolation facilities or
general ward of our hospitals. None of them is in the intensive care
unit.

2.  Details of these trends can be found in MOH’s daily
situation Report (www.moh.gov.sg/covid-19/situation-report).

3.  Of the new cases, 79% are linked to known clusters, while
the rest are pending contact tracing.

4.  MOH has been monitoring existing clusters for any further
transmission. As there have been no more cases linked to boulder+ Gym
(12 Kallang Avenue) for the past two incubation periods (i.e. 28 days),
the cluster has now been closed.



LINKS BETWEEN PREVIOUS CASES FOUND

5.  In the past week (11 April to 17 April), MOH has uncovered
links for 517 previously unlinked cases (see Annex A).

6.  Further epidemiological investigations and contact tracing
have uncovered links between previously announced and new cases. A
summary of the confirmed cases are in Annex B.
