    <title>Expansion of the Enhanced Stay-home Notice Requirements to All Countries</title>
    <body><h1>Expansion of the Enhanced Stay-home Notice Requirements to All Countries</h1>
    <p>Published Date: 08 Apr 2020</p> <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;From 9 April 2020, 2359 hours, all Singapore Citizens, Permanent Residents and Long Term Pass holders entering Singapore will be required to serve a 14-day self-isolation at dedicated Stay-Home Notice (SHN) facilities.<br><br>2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This is a further expansion of our enhanced SHN requirements for travellers returning to Singapore. We started out by requiring returnees from the UK and US to serve a 14-day self-isolation at dedicated SHN facilities. This was subsequently expanded to returnees from ASEAN countries, France, India and Switzerland.<br><br>3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We have since stepped up capacity, and are now able to accommodate fresh returnees from all countries. Nevertheless, if there are unexpected capacity constraints (e.g. due to a larger than expected number of returnees), we may prioritise the dedicated SHN facilities for returnees from certain regions or countries, based on risk assessment.&nbsp; Returnees who are already back in Singapore will continue to serve their 14-day SHN at their current location.<br><br>4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As was earlier announced, all returnees who disregarded prevailing travel advisories and left Singapore from 27 March 2020, would be required to bear the full cost of their 14-day SHN at dedicated SHN facilities.&nbsp;</p></body>
