Published Date: 26 Apr 2020

                As of 26 April 2020, 12pm, the Ministry of Health (MOH)
has confirmed and verified an additional 931 cases of COVID-19 infection
in Singapore. The breakdown is as follows:
A)   IMPORTED CASES: 2
There are 2 imported cases today. Both are Singaporeans who had been
placed on Stay-Home Notice upon arrival in Singapore on 10 April.
B)   CASES IN THE COMMUNITY: 18 (13 Singaporeans/Permanent Residents, 5
Work Passes)
The number of new cases in the community has decreased, from an average
of 31 cases per day in the week before, to an average of 21 per day in
the past week. The number of unlinked cases in the community has also
decreased, from an average of 21 cases per day in the week before, to an
average of 14 per day in the past week. We will continue to closely
monitor these numbers, as well as the cases detected through our
surveillance programme.
C)   WORK PERMIT HOLDERS (RESIDING OUTSIDE DORMITORIES): 25
The number of new cases amongst Work Permit holders residing outside
dormitories has continued to increase, from an average of 20 cases per
day in the week before, to an average of 26 per day in the past week.
D)   WORK PERMIT HOLDERS (RESIDING IN DORMITORIES): 886
The main increase today continues to be for Work Permit holders residing
in dormitories, where we are picking up many more cases because of
extensive testing. Most of these cases have a mild illness and are being
monitored in the community isolation facilities or general ward of our
hospitals. None of them is in the intensive care unit.
2.             Details of these trends can be found in MOHâ€™s daily
situation Report (www.moh.gov.sg/covid-19/situation-report). Please
refer to Annex A for the summary of the confirmed cases.
3.             Of the new cases, 74% are linked to known clusters, while
the rest are pending contact tracing.
4.             MOH has been monitoring existing clusters for any further
transmission. As there have been no more cases linked to Singapore
Cricket Club (A Connaught Drive) and The Wedding Brocade (1 Yishun
Industrial Street 1) for the past two incubation periods (i.e. 28 days),
the clusters have now been closed.
LINKS BETWEEN PREVIOUS CASES FOUND
5.             In the past week (19 April to 25 April), MOH has
uncovered links for 1,280 previously unlinked cases.
6.             Further epidemiological investigations and contact
tracing have uncovered links between previously announced and new cases.
Please refer to Annex B for details.

8.             There are currently 1,311 confirmed cases who are still
