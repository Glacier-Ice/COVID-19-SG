Update On Local Situation Regarding Severe Pneumonia Cluster In Wuhan

Update On Local Situation Regarding Severe Pneumonia Cluster In Wuhan
=====================================================================

Published Date: 11 Jan 2020

Epidemiological investigations, clinical assessment and laboratory test
results from the suspect case reported on 10 January 2020 involving a 26
year-old male Chinese national with pneumonia and travel history to
Wuhan have found that the case is not linked to the pneumonia cluster in
Wuhan. The case has also tested negative for coronavirus.

The Ministry of Health will continue to monitor the situation closely.
As medical practitioners are on the lookout for cases with pneumonia who
have recently returned from Wuhan, Singapore is likely to see more
suspect cases that will need to be investigated for possible links to
the Wuhan cluster.

We urge the public to remain vigilant and to adopt good personal hygiene
practices at all times. Travellers to Wuhan should monitor their health
closely and seek medical attention promptly if they feel unwell, and
also inform their doctor of their travel history.
