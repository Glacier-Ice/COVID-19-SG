              One more case of COVID-19 infection has been discharged
from hospital today (Case 61). In all, 79 have fully recovered from the

2.           As of 4 March 2020, 12pm, the Ministry of Health (MOH) has
confirmed and verified two more cases of COVID-19 infection in
Singapore. Of these, one is linked to a previous case. Contact tracing
is underway for the other case to establish any links to previous cases
or travel history to affected countries or regions.
LINKS BETWEEN PREVIOUS CASES FOUND
3.           Further epidemiological investigations and contact tracing
have uncovered links between previously announced and new cases. This
was made possible with the assistance of the Singapore Police Force.
a)    Six of the locally transmitted confirmed cases (Cases 31, 33, 38,
83, 90 and 91), as well as Cases 8 and 9, are linked to The Life Church
and Missions Singapore. These six cases are linked to another 23
confirmed cases (Cases 48, 49, 51, 53, 54, 57, 58, 60, 61, 62, 63, 66,
67, 68, 70, 71, 73, 74, 78, 80, 81, 84, 88) who are linked to the Grace
Assembly of God.

and 40) are linked to Yong Thai Hang.
c)    Three of the confirmed cases (Cases 30, 36 and 39) are linked to
the business meeting held at Grand Hyatt Singapore from 20 to 22
January.
d)    Five of the confirmed cases (Cases 42, 47, 52, 56 and 69) are
linked to the Seletar Aerospace Heights construction site.
e)    14 of the confirmed cases (Cases 93, 95, 97, 98, 99, 100, 101,
102, 103, 104, 105, 106, 108 and 110) are linked to Wizlearn
Technologies Pte Ltd.
4.           Investigations on these clusters are ongoing. In addition
to the clusters, our investigations have identified the following links
between cases:

-   Case 44 is linked to Cases 13 and 26;
-   Case 72 is linked to Cases 59 and 79;
-   Case 50 is linked to Cases 55, 65 and 77;
-   Case 75 is linked to Case 41;
-   Case 86 is linked to Case 82; and
-   Case 94 is linked to Cases 96, 107 and 112.

5.           Contact tracing is underway for the other 12 locally
transmitted cases to establish any links to previous cases or travel
history to affected countries or regions.

who have a low risk of being infected will be under active surveillance,
and will be contacted daily to monitor their health status.

Province and all non-essential travel to mainland China, Iran, northern
Italy, Japan and the Republic of Korea.
17.         All travellers should monitor their health closely for two
weeks upon return to Singapore and seek medical attention promptly if
they feel unwell. Travellers should inform their doctor of their travel
history. If they have a fever or respiratory symptoms (e.g. cough,
shortness of breath), they should wear a mask and call the clinic ahead
of the visit.
18.         Travellers and members of the public should adopt the
following precautions at all times:

-   Avoid close contact with people who are unwell or showing symptoms
    of illness;
-   Observe good personal hygiene;
-   Practise frequent hand washing with soap (e.g. before handling food
    or eating, after going to toilet, or when hands are dirtied by
    respiratory secretions after coughing or sneezing);
-   Wear a mask if you have respiratory symptoms such as a cough or
    shortness of breath;
-   Cover your mouth with a tissue paper when coughing or sneezing, and
    dispose the soiled tissue paper in the rubbish bin immediately; and
-   Seek medical attention promptly if you are feeling unwell.



19.         MOH will continue to monitor the situation closely. As
medical practitioners are on the lookout for suspect cases, Singapore is
likely to see more cases that will need to be investigated.
