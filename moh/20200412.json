As seen from the chart, the number of imported cases rose around mid-March due to the large number of returnees but has since come down to zero. The number of cases in the community increased following the wave of new imported cases, but there has been some moderation in recent days, in light of the safe-distancing measures that have been put in place earlier. The number of work permit and dormitory-related cases has also increased sharply, and this is likely to continue going up, especially as we undertake more aggressive testing at the dormitories.<br><br>4.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Contact tracing and investigation are underway for currently unlinked cases to establish any links to known clusters or previous cases.
