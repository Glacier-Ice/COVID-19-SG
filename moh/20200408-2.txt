Expansion of the Enhanced Stay-home Notice Requirements to All Countries



EXPANSION OF THE ENHANCED STAY-HOME NOTICE REQUIREMENTS TO ALL COUNTRIES


Published Date: 08 Apr 2020

                 From 9 April 2020, 2359 hours, all Singapore Citizens,
Permanent Residents and Long Term Pass holders entering Singapore will
be required to serve a 14-day self-isolation at dedicated Stay-Home
Notice (SHN) facilities.
2.            This is a further expansion of our enhanced SHN
requirements for travellers returning to Singapore. We started out by
requiring returnees from the UK and US to serve a 14-day self-isolation
at dedicated SHN facilities. This was subsequently expanded to returnees
from ASEAN countries, France, India and Switzerland.
3.            We have since stepped up capacity, and are now able to
accommodate fresh returnees from all countries. Nevertheless, if there
are unexpected capacity constraints (e.g. due to a larger than expected
number of returnees), we may prioritise the dedicated SHN facilities for
returnees from certain regions or countries, based on risk assessment. 
Returnees who are already back in Singapore will continue to serve their
14-day SHN at their current location.
4.            As was earlier announced, all returnees who disregarded
prevailing travel advisories and left Singapore from 27 March 2020,
would be required to bear the full cost of their 14-day SHN at dedicated
SHN facilities.
