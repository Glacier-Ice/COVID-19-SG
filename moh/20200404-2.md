    <p>Published Date: 04 Apr 2020</p> <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The Multi-Ministry Taskforce has announced an elevated set of safe distancing measures as a circuit breaker to pre-empt the trend of increasing local transmission of COVID-19. These will be in place for four weeks (i.e. two incubation cycles) from 7 April 2020 until 4 May 2020 (inclusive). Essential services, including healthcare, will continue to operate during this period.</p> <p><strong>Healthcare Services </strong></p> <p>2.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;All public and private acute hospitals (including offsite specialist clinics and offsite Ambulatory Surgical Centres), community hospitals, polyclinics, Public Health Preparedness Clinics (PHPCs), and renal dialysis centres will remain open for the delivery of essential services.[1]</p><p><p>3.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Non-PHPC General Practitioner (GP) clinics, specialist clinics, dental clinics, and Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) clinics may remain open only for the delivery of essential services. All non-essential appointments should be deferred, and any on-site staffing kept to a minimum.</p></p><p><p>4.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Where possible, services that are suitable for tele-consultation should be delivered remotely. Examples of essential and non-essential face-to-face services are found in <u><a href="/docs/librariesprovider5/pressroom/press-releases/annex-a3685da33172d4ed08bb310ec24a440f8.pdf?sfvrsn=1b80f51f_0" title="Annex A">Annex A</a></u>.</p></p><p><p>5.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Supporting services such as ambulance and patient transport, blood services, laboratories and radiological services, quarantine and isolation operations, and border health operations will continue operations.

Home therapy (except by tele-consult) and Medical Escort and Transport service will also be suspended.</p></p><p><p>8.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Senior care centres, day rehab centres, psychiatric rehabilitation centres, and day hospices will be closed. Selected centres will remain open to support those with inadequate family support, as well as intensive care needs. Such seniors can also be supported with home care services including meals delivery if needed.</p></p><p><p>9.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; See <u><a href="/docs/librariesprovider5/pressroom/press-releases/annex-bd654f2b14b1f4367b437166847b84224.pdf?sfvrsn=75bb563_0" title="Annex B">Annex B</a></u> for the status of community care services during this period.
